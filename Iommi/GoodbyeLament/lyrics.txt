Say a prayer for me in my memory
have a taste another one is through
damn this place in me
damn this destiny
I will be the one who cries when you go

hello misery your the best of me
hey someone got the best of you
come and sleep with me for infinity
we'll spend some time and find the rest of you

break down, breakdown willing in your head
rain down, rain down, innocence is dead

Goodbye Lament, Goodbye Lament
Goodbye faith I swear I won't believe

Pray for me, faded memory
give me and I'll fade into you
come and dance with me
I will always be asleep 
in behind the eyes that I bleed through

break down, breakdown willing in your head
rain down, rain down, innocence is dead

Goodbye Lament, Goodbye Lament,
Goodbye faith I swear I won't believe

Goodbye Lament, Goodbye Lament,
Goodbye faith I swear I won't believe

break down, break down, willing in your head
rain down, rain down, innocence is dead

break down, break down, willing in your head
rain down, rain down, innocense is dead

Goodbye Lament, Goodbye Lament
Goodbye faith I swear I won't believe
