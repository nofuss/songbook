Yeah

[Verse 1]
I been up, I been down
Take my word, my way around
I ain't asking for much
I said, Lord, take me downtown
I'm just looking for some tush

[Verse 2]
I been bad, I been good
Dallas, Texas, Hollywood
I ain't asking for much
I said, Lord, take me downtown
I'm just looking for some tush

Yeah!

[Instrumental Break 0:48-1:28]

[Outro]
Take me back, way back home
Not by myself, not alone
I ain't asking for much
I said, Lord, take me downtown
I'm just looking for some tush
