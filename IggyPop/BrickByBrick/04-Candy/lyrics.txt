It's a rainy afternoon in 1990
The big city
Geez, it's been twenty years
Candy, you were so fine

[Verse 1: Iggy Pop]
Beautiful, beautiful girl from the North
You burned my heart with a flickering torch
I had a dream that no one else could see
You gave me love for free

[Chorus: Iggy Pop]
Candy, Candy, Candy, I can't let you go
All my life, you're haunting me, I loved you so
Candy, Candy, Candy, I can't let you go

[Post-Chorus: Iggy Pop]
Life is crazy
Candy, baby

[Spoken: Kate Pierson]
Yeah, well it hurt me real bad when you left
Hey, I'm glad you got out, but, but I miss you

[Verse 2: Kate Pierson]
I've had a hole in my heart for so long
I've learned to fake it and just smile along
Down on the street, those men are all the same
I need a love, not games, not games

[Chorus: Iggy Pop & Kate Pierson]
Candy, Candy, Candy, I can't let you go
All my life, you're haunting me, I loved you so
Candy, Candy, Candy, I can't let you go

[Bridge: Iggy Pop & Kate Pierson, Kate Pierson]
Life is crazy
I know, baby
Candy, baby
Whoa-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh

[Chorus: Iggy Pop & Kate Pierson]
Candy, Candy, Candy, I can't let you go
All my life, you're haunting me, I loved you so
Candy, Candy, Candy, life is crazy
Candy, baby
Candy, baby
Candy, Candy

[Chorus: Iggy Pop & Kate Pierson]
Candy, Candy, Candy, I can't let you go
All my life, I'm waiting for your loving so
Candy, Candy, Candy, I can't let you go

[Outro: Iggy Pop]
Candy, baby
I can't let you go
