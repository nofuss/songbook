The cops are well-groomed with muscled physiques
In Butt Town
Their tan uniforms are tailored in chic
In Butt Town
Any young black male who walks down the street
Is going to get stopped by a car full of meat
But the girl with the hair flies by in her underwear
She's done nothing so far to deserve that car
When you live in Butt Town
Love is a let down
When you live in Butt Town
You gotta get down

[Chorus]
But in Butt Town, I'm learning
In Butt Town, I'm earning
In Butt Town, I'm turning
Into my worst nightmare

[Verse 2]
I'm telling you, it's a motley crew
In Butt Town
Monday you're new and Friday you're through
In Butt Town
The producer is wily and owns what he sells
The talent is eager to go straight to hell
The tits are amazing and everyone's gazing at some body part
That's the nature of art in Butt Town
All over Butt Town
Dreams have a show down
All over Butt Town
Values are thrown down

[Chorus]
But in Butt Town, I'm learning
In Butt Town, I'm earning
In Butt Town, I'm turning
Into my worst nightmare

[Verse 3]
In Butt Town, baby
I'm gonna be a star
I'm gonna shake my butt far
Now here we go
I'm gonna shake my butt
Shake my butt, shake my butt
In Butt Town
Shake my butt, shake my butt
In Butt Town
