All my life I've been polite
But I'm afraid it's [??]
I'm a man, I know what I want
Gonna take some nerve to get it
When you feel alone and dead
Like you're living in your head
You want power
You want freedom

I wanna tell that girl my story
'Cause baby, you might like my story
When you feel all cut off
And nobody gives you talk
You want power
You want freedom

The loneliness will craze you
Nobody cool will save you
And the system's built to waste you
You want power, freedom

One by one, the lives turn over
If you don't jump, your life is over
Guess now is all that matters
When your spirit's getting flattened
You need power, freedom

The loneliness will craze you
And no one cool will save you
And the system wants to slave you
You want power, freedom

When you feel alone and dead
Like you're living in your head
When you're feeling all cut off
Nobody gives you talk
And no one cool will save you
The system's built to waste you
The loneliness will craze you
Craze you, craze you, craze you
