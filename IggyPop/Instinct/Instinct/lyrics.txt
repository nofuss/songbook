Standing on the borderline
Between joy and reason
Tending carefully, my fire
Waiting for my season

I know who these people are
I know what they stand for
Corruption's built into this plan
Nothing's on the other hand

Tricks and trials
Await the child

The instinct keeps me running
Running like a deer
The instinct keeps me running
Running through the grinning shadows

I have seen the sludgy beach
And the poisoned river
I have met the naughty rich
They're just getting stiffer

This whole place is like a maze
Or like some Medusa
Let me out, I can't accept
A second red light story

Tricks and trials
Await the child

The instinct keeps me running
Running like a deer
The instinct keeps me running
Running where the sun'll bless me

Instinct keeps me running
Running like a moose
The instinct keeps me running
Running to keep one chance open

Marks on walls, the common outlet
Tell the truth and always will
Marks on wall destroy the thought
Of perfect sunny civilization

Tricks and trials
Await the child

Instinct keeps me running
Running like a deer
The instinct keeps me running
Running through the grinning shadows

Instinct keeps me running
Running like a bear
The instinct keeps me running
Running to keep one chance open

Instinct keeps me running
Running 'cause I don't believe it
Instinct keeps me running
Running through the bare emotion

Instinct keeps me running
Instinct keeps me running
Running, I'm running
Running, running, running
