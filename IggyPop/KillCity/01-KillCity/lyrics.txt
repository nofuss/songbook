Well, I live here in kill city
Where the debris meets the sea
I live here in kill city
Where the debris meets the sea
It's a playground to the rich
But it's a loaded gun to me

[Verse 2]
Well, I'm sick of keeping quiet
And I am the wild boy
I'm sick of keeping quiet
And I am the wild boy
But if I have to die here first
I'm gonna make some noise

[Chorus]
Give it up, turn the boy loose
Give it up, turn the boy loose
Give it up, turn the boy loose
Turn that boy loose

[Verse 3]
Yeah, the scene is fascination
Man, and everything's for free
The scene is fascination, man
And everything's for free
'Til you wind up in some bathroom
Overdosed and on your knees

[Chorus]
Give it up, turn the boy loose
Give it up, turn the boy loose
Give it up, turn the boy loose
Give it up, turn the boy loose
Give it up, turn the boy loose
Give it up, turn the boy loose
Give it up, turn the boy loose
Give it up
