Rockshow
You came to see a rockshow
A big gigantic cock show
You came to see it all

Rock show
You came to hear it
You came to sear it
You came to do it all

If you think you're gonna
Get it for credit
Forget it
Don't bet
Call the medic
He's pathetic
He's got to let it go

Let's go
Rock show
Come on
Rock show
You came to see a rock show
This isn't a fuckin' talk show
You came to see it all

Rock show
You came to fear it
You came to sear it
You came to do it all

It's me you want for credit
Forget it
Don't panic
Call in the medic
He's pathethic
He's got to let it go

Cause if you gonna get it
For credit
Forget it
Don't bet it
Call in the medic
It's pathetic
He's gonna let it go

Let's go
Rock show
Come on
Rock show
Let's go
Rock show
Let's go
Rock show
