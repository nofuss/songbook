I'm bored
I'm the chairman of the bored
I'm a lengthy monologue
I'm livin' like a dog
I'm bored

[Chorus]
I bore myself to sleep at night
I bore myself in broad daylight
'Cause I'm bored
Just another slimy bore

[Verse 2]
I'm free to bore my well-bought friends
And spend my cash until the end
'Cause I'm bored
I'm bored
I'm the chairman of the bored

[Refrain]
I'm sick
I'm sick of all my kicks
I'm sick of all the stiffs
I'm sick of all the dips
I'm bored

[Chorus]
I bore myself to sleep at night
I bore myself in broad daylight
'Cause I'm bored
I'm bored
Just another dirty bore

[Bridge]
Alright, doll-face
Come on and bore me

[Instrumental Break]

[Refrain]
I'm sick
I'm sick of all my kicks
I'm sick of all the stiffs
I'm sick of all the dips
I'm sick

[Chorus]
I'm sick when I go to sleep at night
I'm still sick in the broad daylight
'Cause I'm bored
I'm bored
I'm the chairman of the bored
