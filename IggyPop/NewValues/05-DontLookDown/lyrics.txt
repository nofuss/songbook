Don't look down
They're making sorta crazy sounds

[Verse 1]
So why be bored?
Who scared you and why stay there?
It's no piece of cake
When I hear that crazy sound, I don't look down

[Chorus]
From Central Park to shanty town
I always hear that crazy sound
From New York to shanty town
There's always something else

[Verse 2]
I went this morning to the cemetery
To see old Rudy Valentino buried
Lipstick traces on his name
He never looked down

[Chorus]
'Cause they were making crazy sounds
From Central Park to shanty town
He always heard that crazy sound
There's always something else (Mm-mm)

Yeah
Yeah, yeah
Oh-oh, do, do, do
Ayy, uh-huh, yeah, uh-huh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Just tune into crazy sounds, oh-oh

[Verse 3]
When I see you standin' there
I can't see the clothes you wear
I just hear that crazy sound and I can't look down

[Chorus]
From New York to shanty town
I'll always hear that crazy sound
From New York to shanty town
There's always something else

[Bridge]
So why be bored?
Who scared you and why stay here?
This is no piece of cake
When I hear that crazy sound, I don't look down

[Chorus]
From Central Park to shanty town
I'll always hear that crazy sound
From New York to shanty town
I'm looking good, I don't look down
I'm looking good
