[Verse 1]
I'm healthy as a horse
Ah, but everything is spinnin'
And if I use a gun
I'm sure to go to prison
I'm stubborn as a mule
And nobody breaks my rules
Ah, but nothing comes my way

[Verse 2]
I got a hard-ass pair of shoulders
I got a love you can't imagine
Yeah, and what I got, I double
I swear, I'm keeping out of trouble

[Chorus]
I'm looking for one new value
I'm looking for one new value
But nothing comes my way

[Post-Chorus]
Brr
Ow, ow, ow, ow

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
We live in the same room
We live in the 20th century
[?]
We are so unused

[Outro]
Ah, but nothing comes my way
