get your motor runnin'
head out on the highway
looking for adventure
jn whatever comes our way

[Chorus]
yeah, darlin', go and make it happen
take the world in a love embrace
fire all of your guns at once
and explode into space

[Verse 2]
I like smoke and lightnin'
heavy metal thunder
racing with the wind
and the feeling that I'm under

[Chorus]
yeah, darlin', go and make it happen
take the world in a love embrace
fire all of your guns at once
and explode into space

[Bridge]
like a true nature's child
we were born, born to be wild
we can climb so high
I never wanna die
born to be wild
born to be wild

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 1]
get your motor runnin'
head out on the highway
looking for adventure
in whatever comes our way

[Chorus]
yeah, darlin', go and make it happen
take the world in a love embrace
fire all of your guns at once
and explode into space

[Outro]
like a true nature's child
we were born, born to be wild
we can climb so high
I never wanna die
born to be wild
born to be wild
