One, two, three, four, five, six
(Whoa-oh-oh, whoa)
(Whoa-oh-oh, whoa)
(Whoa-oh-oh, whoa)
(Whoa-oh-oh, whoa)

[Verse 1]
I don't wanna spend the rest of my life
Lookin' at the barrel of an Armalite
I don't wanna spend the rest of my days
Keepin' outta trouble like the soldiers say

[Verse 2]
I don't wanna spend my time in hell
Lookin' at the walls of a prison cell
I don't ever wanna play the part
Of a statistic on a government chart

[Chorus]
There has to be an invisible sun
It gives its heat to everyone
There has to be an invisible sun
That gives us hope when the whole day's done

[Verse 3]
It's dark all day and it glows all night
Factory smoke and acetylene light
I face the day with my head caved in
Lookin' like somethin' that the cat brought in
You might also like
Too Much Information
The Police
Area Codes
Kaliii
King of Pain
The Police
[Chorus]
There has to be an invisible sun
It gives its heat to everyone
There has to be an invisible sun
That gives us hope when the whole day's done

[Guitar Solo]
(Whoa-oh-oh, whoa)
(Whoa-oh-oh, whoa)

[Verse 4]
And they're only gonna change this place
By killin' everybody in the human race
They would kill me for a cigarette
But I don't even wanna die just yet

[Chorus]
There has to be an invisible sun
It gives its heat to everyone
There has to be an invisible sun
That gives us hope when the whole day's done

[Outro]
(Whoa-oh-oh, whoa)
(Whoa-oh-oh, whoa)
(Whoa-oh-oh, whoa)
(Whoa-oh-oh, whoa)
(Whoa-oh-oh, whoa)
(Whoa-oh-oh, whoa)
(Whoa-oh-oh, whoa)
(Whoa-oh-oh, whoa)
(Whoa-oh-oh, whoa)
(Whoa-oh-oh, whoa)
(Whoa-oh-oh, whoa)
