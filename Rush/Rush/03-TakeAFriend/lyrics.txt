Well, I'm looking at you
And I'm wondering what you're gonna do
Looks like you got no friends
No one to stick with you till the end

[Chorus]
Take yourself a friend
Keep them till the end
Whether woman or man
It makes you feel so good
So good

[Verse 2]
Yes, you think you're all right
But now you're lonely every night
Well, you need a friend
Someone on whom you can always depend

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Yes, you need some advice
Well, let me put it to you nice
I said you need a friend
Someone who'll stick with you to the end
