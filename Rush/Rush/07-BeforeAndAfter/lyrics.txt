Love won't see me comin'
On a Sunday noon today
Still don't believe we're fadin'
But now the world should wait

And now you're finally listenin'
To what I have to say
Well, the time is right
And it is today

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Maybe we could talk about it
And try to get it straight
After all these years, baby
Maybe it's too late

But I really need to
Have you by my side
And that's the only feelin'
Baby, I can't hide

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Well you aren't listenin'
I ain't talkin'
We ain't gettin' nowhere

I keep tryin' to get through to you baby
All you do is stare

I don't wanna see that
I need you by my side
Well, I don't want to be your lover
Babe, I wanna be your man

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Well, now my story's over, baby
And I ain't gonna tell it twice
Well, you better start listenin'
Or get out of my life

Or you're gonna be left out
I said left out in the cold
Yeah, before you get my lovin'
Babe, you'll be too old

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Well, I'm talkin' to you baby
Well, I said yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
