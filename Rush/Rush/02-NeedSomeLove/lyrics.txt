I'm runnin' here, I'm runnin' there
I'm lookin' for a girl
'Cause there's nothin' I need, there's nothin' I want more
In the whole wide world

Well, I need it quick and I need it now
Before I start to fade away
That's why I'm searchin', that's why I'm lookin'
Each and ev'ry day

[Chorus:]
Ooh, I need some love
I said I need some love
Ooh yes, I need some love
This feelin' I can't rise above
Ooh, yeah, yeah

Well, I been hustlin' here, I been hustlin' there
I been searchin' for about a week
And I started feelin' this strange sensation
My knees are startin' gettin' weak

Well, I need what keeps a young man alive
I'm sayin' I need it now
I'm gonna get the message across to you
Some way, some how
