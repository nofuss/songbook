Hey, now, baby
Well, I like your smile
Won't you come and talk to me
For a little while?

Well, you're makin' me crazy
The way you roll them eyes
Won't you come and sit with me?
I'll tell you all my lies

[Chorus:]
Hey, baby, it's a quarter to eight
I feel I'm in the mood
Hey baby, the hour is late
I feel I've got to move

Well, hey, now, baby
Don't you talk so fast
I'm just tryin' to make these good times
I'm tryin' to make it last

Everything's getting hazy
Now honey, where'd you go?
I just want to find out, baby...
Where'd you learn what you know?

[Chorus]

Well, hey, now, baby
I said I like your style
You really got me, baby
Way down deep inside

Ooh, you drive me crazy
Baby, you're the one
I just want to rock and roll you woman
Until the night is gone
