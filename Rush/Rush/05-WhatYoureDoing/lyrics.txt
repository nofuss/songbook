ell, I see you standin' there
With your finger in the air
Everything we do, you wanna leave it up to you

Who do you think you are?
You think you are a star?
Tryin' to run the town
Always tryin' to put us down

Well, you think that you're right
You think you're out of sight
Tell me something, mister
Why'd you have to make us so uptight?


Well, you better start changin'
Your life needs rearrangin'
You better do some talkin'
Or you better do some walkin' now

Yeah, you think that you're right
You think you're out of sight
Tell me something, mister
Why'd you have to make us so uptight?

I know what you're doing
All that you been doin' wrong
I don't know what you're feelin'
Oh, but you been feelin' long

Well, you think that you're right
Tell me something, mister
Why'd you have to make us so uptight?
