I said I played this song so many times before
That the melody keeps repeating
Growing new ideas, flowing chords and notes
Like a mountain river bleeding

Well, I say as I look back at all the thoughts I've had
They reflect just what I'm learning
Yes, you know that the hardest part, yes, I say it is to stay on top
On top of a world forever churning

Well, you say you can laugh, but I can see that your eyes are glass
Well, do you see, can't you see, what I'm feeling?
Yes, I've seen your face before
Why, I've seen it everywhere
Showing up to me without a scent revealing

Well, I said will it ever change?
Will it stay the same?
I'd surely like to know before it's over
Well, I said I played some
I said it won't be long
Won't be long before I stop and play it over

You know I've, I've seen your face before
Is it ever gonna, ever gonna change again?
Oh, oh, I've, I've been in one place too long
Is it ever gonna, ever gonna change again?
