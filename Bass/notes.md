From https://how-to-play-bass.com/play-bass-in-50-songs-rock

X 1) YELLOW by Coldplay. Here’s a nice simple line to get started with.

X 2) WITH OR WITHOUT YOU by U2. One of my favourite U2 songs – simple bass line too, four chords, root notes in a steady 8th note pulse.

X 3) EVERY BREATH YOU TAKE by The Police. The first of three Sting basslines. This one’s mainly root notes, mainly 8th notes.

X 4) ROXANNE by The Police. A nice example of the Police’s early mix of reggae and rock (see also ‘So Lonely’).

X 5) MESSAGE IN A BOTTLE by The Police. Another great Sting line, he’s not a virtuoso but he plays memorable bass lines.

X 6) ANOTHER ONE BITES THE DUST by Queen. One of the most recognisable basslines in bassdom, played by one of its most underrated players – John Deacon (crap claim to fame: I went to the same school as John Deacon!).

X 7) ADDICTED TO LOVE by Robert Palmer Interesting 80s rock bassline – learn to rock without the root note on the downbeat. Oh and great video too! (if a bit sexist)

X 8) DAYTRIPPER by The Beatles The Beatles wrote great tunes, Paul McCartney played great basslines. this riff based tune can be played much heavier than the Beatles original.

X 9) NEW YEARS DAY by U2 A simple Adam Clayton line, 8th notes all the way.

X 10) LIGHT MY FIRE by The Doors. Nice 8th note bassline with lots of major and minor triads.

X 11) MONEY FOR NOTHING by Dire Straits. I’ve got a feeling Sting might have played the bassline on this, it’s a nice 8th note riff kind of song.

X 12) SATISFACTION by The Rolling Stones Simple yet effective Bill Wyman 8th note line on classic 60s rock track.

X 13) KEEP ON RUNNING by Spencer Davies Group. A great track featuring Muff Winwood’s iconic driving bassline, the whole tune was reportedly written in less than 10 minutes once he’d come up with the bassline.

X 14) YOU CAN DRIVE MY CAR by The Beatles More McCartney 8th notes from his transtional mid sixties period.

15) LIVING ON A PRAYER by Bon Jovi 80s stadium rock, Bon Jovi style so big hair and lots of 8th notes!

16) YOU REALLY GOT ME by The Kinks Another typical 60s style rock line

17) SUNSHINE OF YOUR LOVE by Cream. Learn an iconic bass riff and the blues scale in a single two bar measure! Jack Bruce with Cream, ’nuff said!

18) BROWN SUGAR by The Rolling Stones Another Stones classic, another Bill Wyman bass line – simple but effective.

19) BET THAT YOU LOOK GOOD ON THE DANCEFLOOR by Arctic Monkeys Great contemporary tune, a good one for the rock jam repertoire.

20) I BELIEVE IN A THING CALLED LOVE by The Darkness Straightforward riff based rock tune.

21) YOU GIVE LOVE A BAD NAME by Bon Jovi More Bon Jovi, more 8th note rock.

22) COME AS YOU ARE by Nirvana Some seattle grunge – 8th note style!

23) I SAW HER STANDING THERE by The Beatles Another McCartney line, this one’s a good right hand workout, lots of 8th notes at a brisk tempo (approx 160 BPM).

24) ARE YOU GONNA GO MY WAY by Lenny Kravitz I always enjoy gigging this tune, it’s got a cool basic groove plus some rhythmic embellishments and a guitar solo sections that’s great for drums and bass to play (especially if the drummer’s got a double bass pedal!).

25) CRAZY LITTLE THING CALLED LOVE by Queen. Another John Deacon bassline to another Queen classic – this one introduces the shuffle feel.

26) SWEET HOME CHICAGO by Blues Brother. Not strictly a rock tune but a 12 bar blues featuring Duck Dunn swinging his butt off (the extended film soundtrack version has got some nice upper register work too!).

27) ALL MY LOVING by The Beatles. Another McCartney line, this time a lesson in how to walk through a pop tune. See also 29 below.

28) SPIRIT IN THE SKY by Norm Greenbaum A popular tune, nice shuffle bassline.

29) EIGHT DAYS A WEEK by The Beatles. See 27 above!

30) METAL GURU by T Rex An underrated band whose time was tragically cut short, this tune is a great example of a mid tempo rock shuffle.

31) TOWN CALLED MALICE by The Jam

32) RUNNING FREE by IRON MAIDEN. A heavy shuffle this time, one of the first Maiden classics.

33) MY GENERATION by The Who A classic bassline from The OX (Jon Entwistle). Features include his great bass solo plus playing straight 8ths over the shuffle rhythm.

34) HEY JOE by Jimi Hendrix. Hey Joe is a rock jam standard – Noel Redding’s bass line introduces students to playing 16th notes at a reasonable tempo!

35) TIME IS RUNNING OUT by Muse The first of three basslines by Chris Wolstenhome (and my favourite Muse track).

36) PURPLE HAZE by Jimi Hendrix Another jamming standard, great tune, great line.

37) SUNDAY BLOODY SUNDAY by U2 I’ve got a soft spot for this one, it’s one of the first tunes I gigged regularly back in the day (“Le Pub” in the ski resort of Meribel with a french guitarist/vocalist called Christophe Magnon) – it’s not particularly complex but is another good intro to 16th notes.

38) PINBALL WIZARD by The Who Another great tune by the Who, another great performance by The Ox.

39) CALIFORNICATION by The Red Hot Chilli Peppers – First of three bass lines from Flea, the cool line to Californication features some melodic upper register playing as well as some more typical lower register rocking 16th notes. A personal fave!

40) HARD TO HANDLE by The Black Crowes The original (Otis Redding) was a great track, this version is OK but is a nice feature for a rocking 16th note bass line.

41) YOU OUGHTA KNOW by Alanis Morisette You wait 40 odd songs for a Flea bass line to come along and then like buses here come’s another. Great song, great bass line, loads of 16th notes, ghost notes and tasty fills to feast on.

42) SMELLS LIKE TEEN SPIRIT by Nirvana Some more Seattle style grunge

43) CROSSROADS by Cream. My favourite Jack Bruce track with Cream (his favourite is Politician which shows you how much I know!) A masterclass in the blues, rock style.

44) AEROPLANE by The Red Hot Chilli Peppers And here’s another barrage from Flea’s furious fingers!

45) SMOOTH CRIMINAL by Alien Ant Farm I had to gig this a few times about five years ago – great version of a classic MJ song, great bassline, great exercise in 16th notes.

46) ANTHEM by Rush Geddy Lee was probably more responsible than anyone for me picking up a bass guitar in the first place. By Rush standards this is a fairly conventional tune, but you gotta love what Geddy plays under the guitar solo. Class with a capital C!

47) HIT ME WITH YOUR RHYTHM STICK by Ian Drury and the Blockheads This is an unusual song choice – it’s not a rock tune in the classic sense, but it’s got a restless punky energy to it – and a killer bassline!

48) NUMBER OF THE BEAST by Iron Maiden Another one from Steve Harris – another bass player highly underrated IMO. This song’s got everything you’d expect in a Maiden song – high register intro work, tons of 16th note moshes and gallops, some tricky unison lines and even some odd time signature! Great workout.

49) HYSTERIA by Muse One of Chris Wolstenholme’s finest, another great workout.

50) STOCKHOLM SYNDROME by Muse Same as HYSTERIA. When you’ve finished the course and learnt all of these tunes you’ll have a thorough grounding in the rock idiom and be on the cusp of progressing from a beginner to an intermediate level bass player!


## Play Bass In 50 Songs – Soul

From https://how-to-play-bass.com/play-bass-in-50-songs-soul

X 1) STAND BY ME. A nice simple line to start with that repeats throughout the song.

2) MY GIRL. The first (of many) Jamerson lines. A simple line with a memorable hook underpinning the soulful sound of the Temptations.

3) DOCK OF THE BAY. The song that (posthumously) made Otis Redding an international superstar. Legend has it that the whistled outro was an adlib because Otis forgot the words. A simple Duck Dunn bassline.

4) I SAY A LITTLE PRAYER. The Groovemaster himself – Mr Jerry Jemmott – underpins this Aretha Franklin tune.

5) MUSTANG SALLY. Duck Dunn again – this Wilson Pickett song is a staple in the repertoire of cover bands. Most players reference the version played by The Commitments – but the Wicked Pickett’s version is superior!

6) IN THE MIDNIGHT HOUR. Another cover band staple, another simple yet effective Duck Dunn line.

7) SATISFACTION. The only song in both the Rock and Soul 50 Song list – this version is Otis Redding’s and features – yeah, you guessed it – Duck Dunn again.

8) TIME IS TIGHT. I love Duck’s work with Booker T – Time is Tight is a great tune with a great unison line.

9) I HEARD IT THROUGH THE GRAPEVINE. Jamerson’s line on the Marvin Gaye classic. Another must know song from most cover band’s repertoire.

10) SAME OLD SONG. This Four Tops classic has a typical mid sixties soul style bass line (see also I CAN’T HELP MYSELF and CAN’T TURN YOU LOOSE below for similar), at a faster tempo than some of the earlier tunes. The challenge is to keep the picking hand technique even and consistent.

11) KNOCK ON WOOD. Another Duck Dunn tune – he truly had mastered the greasy soul 8th note feel of the period. This tune features a bit more syncopation and some higher register notes.

12) YOU CAN’T HURRY LOVE. A memorable Jamerson line. Here’s a challenge – try playing the song with a totally different bass part, different notes, different rhythms. That exercise will go a long way to teaching you about Jamerson’s genius – the bass line MAKES the song!

13) I CAN’T HELP MYSELF . See 10 above – more of the same!

14) LOST IN MUSIC. We fast forward to the late 70s for this Bernard Edwards classic – it’s deceptively simple note wise but it’s all about note length and the groove.

15) LET’S GROOVE. An EW&F tune, as with LOST IN MUSIC there’s nothing fancy notewise but the tune is all about the groove.

16) I FEEL GOOD. James Brown. The Godfather. ‘Nuff said.

17) THIS OLD HEART OF MINE – another mid sixties Motown tune with a Jamerson line. Great tune, great to play.

18) UPTIGHT. Early Stevie Wonder. Another great tune that’s fun to play.

19) I CAN’T TURN YOU LOOSE. More Duck Dunn 8th notes. Keeping it even at the song’s tempo is the challenge.

20) SHAKE A TAILFEATHER. The Blues Brother’s version. A good workout for left and right hand co-ordination.

21) GREEN ONIONS. We start looking at shuffles with Green Onions. Simple minor blues, but a great illustration of the shuffle feel.

22) BABY LOVE. A tune with a really subtle shuffle feel. This is from back in the day when Jamerson kept it simple.

23) MY GUY. And so’s this – the original was played on Jamerson’s upright and you can really hear his jazz background in some of his pull offs chord descends. Great outro too, very cool.

24) 634-5789. Another Duck Dunn shuffle on this often overlooked Wilson Pickett tune.

25) SWEET HOME CHICAGO. And here’s another Duck Dunn shuffle. Check out the upper register work on the extended version from the Blues Brothers soundtrack.

26) YOU SEND ME. Jerry Jemmott put in a class performance on this Aretha tune. Technically speaking this is a tune in 12/8 rather than a shuffle, but the bassline is so good I couldn’t resist putting it in.

27) HEATWAVE. This is an interesting Jameson line. he plays a ‘walking’ shuffle on this tune in the same way that McCartney does on ALL MY LOVING in the rock tunes version of the list.

28) THIS TIME IT’S REAL. Finally we can get Rocco Prestia in on the action! Rocco is a master of the shuffle and this tune is a great example of it – for the virtuoso example of it check CREDIT below.

29) HOW SWEET IT IS. Junior Walker’s version of this tune let Jameson stretch out – compare this with Marvin Gaye’s reading of the same tune which I believe was recorded a year or so earlier. Jameson could play a nasty shuffle when he wanted to, check out this tune for the proof.

30) I’LL TAKE YOU THERE. We’re starting to introduce 16th notes now – this Staple Singers groove is a modest tempo but has a great line with a great feel.

31) SHOTGUN. More Jameson and Junior Walker. Predominantly an eight note groove with some sixteenth notes in the intro.

32) SOUL MAN. Duck Dunn again with Sam and Dave this time. Great song. Great line. What else is there to say?

33) SEPTEMBER. A Verdine White classic. My favourite EW&F tune to boot.

34) SEX MACHINE. James Brown. AND Bootsy? That’s tooooo funky.

35) I WISH. I think long time Stevie sideman Nathan Watts played this line – but I could be wrong. Whoever played it, it’s a very cool line to get under your fingers.

36) SUPER BAD. More James Brown. More Bootsy.

37) GOOD TIMES. This tune is played by loads of cover bands so it’s always worth knowing. Bernard Edwards’ grooves are always deep in the pocket and this one’s no exception.

38) THINKING OF YOU. This tune is often overlooked when bass players look at Bernard’s work (Le Freak, We are Family, Everybody Dance etc etc often get the attention). But it’s deceptively difficult, nailing the chorus is a great left hand workout for any bassist.

39) THINK

40) CISSY STRUT

41) ATTITUDE DANCE. This is one of my favourite Tower of Power tunes from my favourite TOP album – Monster on a Leash (always reminds me of a four week gig in St Tropez where this was never off the stereo). The bassline is a great example of how muting can really lift a line and make it drive.

42) WHAT’S GOING ON. Reportedly this was one of Jameson’s favourite bass lines/songs/sessions. And one of his first published credits. See STANDING IN THE SHADOWS OF MOTOWN for a poignant account of his life story – and 49 transcriptions of his work.

43) REACH OUT I’LL BE THERE. Levi Stubbs belting it out. Jameson laying it down. A match in motown heaven.

44) WHAT IS HIP. Rocco’s 16th note anthem. A great study in right hand picking (unless you’re left handed!).

45) ONLY SO MUCH OIL IN THE GROUND. Ditto but with more time appropriate lyrics than when the song was first released (mid 70s).

46) HOME COOKING. There’s a great transcription of this in STANDING IN THE SHADOWS OF MOTOWN – it’s a truly great bass line. Only bettered by….

47) BERNADETTE. More Levi Stubbs. More Jameson. This IMO is almost the pinnacle of Jameson’s motown work.

48) CREDIT. This should really be in the shuffles section (Song 20 to 29) but the technical demands of this Tower of Power tune are such that it got bumped down to Week 48. A killing bassline, almost Rocco’s finest hour (IMO)…

49) COUNT ON ME. A totally overlooked song in the Tower of Power canon – with a wicked percolating 16th note bassline. Master this one and you’ll be funking for the real thing!

50) FOR ONCE IN MY LIFE. This tune is the pinnacle of Jameson’s work at Motown. You could study it for months and still be taking lessons out of it. Here’s two staggering facts: the line was probably improvised, every SINGLE bar is different. It’s like a concerto for bass. Seriously STANDING IN THE SHADOWS OF MOTOWN is worth buying just for the transcription and play along of this tune (played by another truly great bass player, Pino Palladino).
