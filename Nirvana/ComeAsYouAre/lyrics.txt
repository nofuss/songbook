Come as you are, as you were,
As I want you to be
As a friend, as a friend,
As an old enemy.

Take your time, hurry up
The choice is yours,
Don't be late.
Take a rest as a friend,
As an old memory, ah
Memory, ah [3x]

Come dowsed in mud, soaked in bleach
As I want you to be
As a trend, as a friend, as an old memory, ah
Memory, ah [3x]

And I swear that I don't have a gun
No I don't have a gun [2x]

Memory, ah [3x]

Memory, ah - and I don't have a gun

And I swear that I don't have a gun
No I don't have a gun [4x]

Memory, ah [2x]
