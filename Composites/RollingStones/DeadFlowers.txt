D   A   G   D
Well when you're sitting there in your silk upholstered chair
D   A   G   D
Talkin' to some rich folk that you know
D   A   G   D
Well I hope you won't see me in my ragged company
D   A   G   D
Well, you know I could never be alone

A   A   D   D
Take me down little Susie, take me down
A   A   D   D
I know you think you're the queen of the underground
G   G   D   D
And you can send me dead flowers every morning
G   G   D   D
Send me dead flowers by the mail
G   G   D   D
Send me dead flowers to my wedding
D   A   G   D
And I won't forget to put roses on your grave

D   A   G   D
Well when you're sitting back in your rose pink Cadillac
D   A   G   D
Making bets on Kentucky Derby Day
D   A   G   D
Ah, I'll be in my basement room with a needle and a spoon
D   A   G   D
And another girl to take my pain away

A   A   D   D
Take me down little Susie, take me down
A   A   D   D
I know you think you're the queen of the underground
G   G   D   D
And you can send me dead flowers every morning
G   G   D   D
Send me dead flowers by the mail
G   G   D   D
Send me dead flowers to my wedding
D   A   G   D
And I won't forget to put roses on your grave

G   G   D   D
And you can send me dead flowers every morning
G   G   D   D
Send me dead flowers by the U.S. Mail
G   G   D   D
Say it with dead flowers in my wedding
D   A   G   D
And I won't forget to put roses on your grave
D   A   G   D
No, I won't forget to put roses on your grave
