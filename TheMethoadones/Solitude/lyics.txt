I'm gonna hang out with myself. 
I won't be in debt to anybody 
Or have to worry about pushing anyone 
'Cause I don't want them around. 

And everybody around me has told me things that I don't believe 
Seems like everyone around is pleased when I'm not happy. 

I'm all alone again, 
And I'm perfectly content for now. 

As I dream of somewhere else, 
I won't have to answer to anybody 
Or have to listen to the moronic views that I hear everywhere. 
As I wonder, I start to doubt that anyone would have relief 
To a lie he's gonna say before I walk away 
There's no use in trying to explain? 

I'm all alone again, 
And I'm perfectly content. 
Yeah, I'm all alone again, 
And I'm perfectly content for now.
