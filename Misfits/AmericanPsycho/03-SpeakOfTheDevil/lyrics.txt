Traded in my bible for a little black cat
The time of armageddon's here
Some call me the son of the morning
God knows I'm the angel of light

I drink my water from a wolf's footprint
My soul's redemptive work of Christ
God know I'm the angel of light

Speak of the Devil... Speak of the Devil
Devil!

Believers be on guard, be strong and take a stand
The time of armageddon's here
Some call me the son of the morning

Speak of the Devil
