A pounding pulse stirs anxious feelings
Inside sick breaths of undead life

"Help me angel evil" cried
The children of the night
Take this wasted mortal life
Melt me into Blacklight

Lie on the floor and let the body die
Become the beasts in which you fear

"Help me angel evil" cried
The children of the night
Take this wasted mortal life
Melt me into Blacklight
