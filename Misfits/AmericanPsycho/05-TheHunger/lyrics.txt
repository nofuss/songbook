We become
Erupt in violence
Destroy the silence
Our time has come, go!

We are the outcasted, ancient descendants
The ones who've been calling and
Would you still die for the dead, yet still living
Starved of a time that's now come, whoa-oh
We are the children
The hungry children

We become
Erupt in violence
Seduce the silence
Our time has come, go!

We are the kindred, Hell's ancient descendant slaves
Begging the night not to go
Would you still die for the dead, yet still living
Starved of a life that's now gone, whoa-oh
We are the children
The hungry children

We become
(Blood quench the hunger)
You want it, you need it
(A blood quench the hunger)
You want it, you need it
(The blood quench the hunger)
You want it, you need it
Oh, oh
