Inside a wall street mind a psycho lurks
Lines of cocaine cut in hell
Obsessive hands gently grab your neck
Compulsively you'll die...
I hate people!

Struggling to breathe -Go!

The sweet asphyxiation and dismemberment
Sex puts me in the mood to make you die
Obsessive hands gently grab your neck
Look into sick eyes...
I hate people!

Struggling to breathe -Go!

Go! - A machine of penalty
Go! - The sweet insanity
Go! - Fade to black tranquility

You're lookin' through the eyes of a psycho!
An American psycho!
