Buried beneath the statue the answer hides
Enduring throughout the ages
The transmitter lies
Once the chambers open the signal will be sent
To another world... Far beyond the stars

Don't open till Doomsday
Destruction's not far away
Don't open till Doomsday
You may not like what you find inside

We were warned of this coming so long ago
Immortal secrets... man shouldn't know
Entering a realm where we just don't belong
We called them and they're coming

Don't open till Doomsday
Destruction's not far away
Don't open till Doomsday
You may not like what you find inside
