Their eyes for many centuries
Peered in from space
Sincere their hope, their wise belief
That they could teach our race
But yet on Mars, a darker side
Like all things that god made
Their tribe of war, would heed them not
Earth they must invade!

See the fire in the skies
See them devastate the land
Mars attacks!
The warlord chief commands
See the humans fight and die!
See our planet laid to waste
Mars attacks!
Monsters invade the Earth from space

It was then, in our darkest hour
When everything seemed lost
The hearts of man would not concede
No matter what the cost
They forged a sword of sound and steel
Upon the Martian doors
The voice of god would thunder there
Mars would be no more!

See the Martian cities fall
See the death of the warrior tribe
Mars attacks!
Now the planet will survive
See their world turn into ash
See the terror on their face
Mars explodes!
Now there's rubble into space

Wo-ho-o-o-oh
Wo-ho-o-o-oh
Mars attacks
Monsters invade the Earth from space
Wo-ho-o-o-oh
Wo-ho-o-o-oh
Wo-o-o-o-o-oh
