[Verse 1]
Complications inside of me reminds me that
My heart won't always beat
The ugly face of death that's smiling
At my rotting teeth

[Chorus]
I will die here in this sorrow
I was waiting for tomorrow
Palpitate the pulse until
You feel your heart explode against the wall

[Post-Chorus]
Talk about me
Laugh about me
Cry about me
Nail me to the cross

[Verse 2]
I'll be a martyr for the hated
The weak, the ugly, the lost

[Chorus]
I will die here in this sorrow
I won't wait for your tomorrow
Palpitate the pulse until
You resurrect my soul from the wall

[Post-Chorus]
Talk about me
Laugh about me
Cry about me
Nail me to the cross
