They'll find pieces of you
scattered on the ground
I am the madman in your dreams
We are the evil ones

We need the planet to demonstrate
We want your body to incubate
Begin the breeding of an alien superior race
That in which will ultimately dominate

Give into what you cannot fight
Walk Among Us! Walk Among Us!

The abductions have already begun
All around us we've infected someone you love
Initiate the start of an alien war
We're already one!

Give into what you cannot fight
Walk Among Us! Walk Among Us!
