Furious the exodus walks
Along the maddening march of death
With the furor and the masses
Whose supremacies is the dominion
Alien bodies stiff and cold
Your inner sane turns numb
You transform into a rage
Too naive to understand

And they go on as the sacrifice grows
We're living on ground zero - fire!
(This Island Earth!)
Target locked, system checked, enter code
We're living on ground zero - fire!

Locked up in a room
Human beings in a cage
The sentence a scienced death
As they pull the trigger of ray guns
Evil blackedned eyes of youth
Absorbing life's hidden anguish
Death thrown about the ground
Or those who wouldn't fight

And they go on as the sacrifice grows
We're living on ground zero - fire!
Target locked, system checked, enter code
We're living on ground zero - fire!

We're living on this island earth
