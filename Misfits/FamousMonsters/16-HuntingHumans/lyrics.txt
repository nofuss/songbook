Upon this thresh-hold of disaster
The birth of the eleventh plague
The fires burn at night,I begin to doubt
-The Smell of flesh-will ever fade away

The touch of Death is all around us
A thousand corpses block our way
A man-made germ makes almost everyone-
commit suicide
Just to rise and eat their dead
Night of the Living Dead

We're hunting humans
We're hunting humans
We're hunting humans
It's killing time everyday

I can't control this eerie feeling
An evil screaming in my ear
I don't think I'll last the night,
there is no cure for this genocide
Or ressurection of the dead
Night of the Living Dead....
