Whoa oh oh
Whoa oh oh
Whoa oh oh
Scream!!
A chill runs up your spine
And crawls into your brain
A freezing touch of fear
It's driving me insane
Although you try to fight
Dragged from the silence where you hide
Till you scream
Till you scream
A chill runs up your spine
And crawls into your brain
A freezing touch of fear
It's driving me insane
Although you try to fight
Dragged from the silence where you hide
Till you scream
Till you scream
Scream
I can't wait to hear you scream
It's driving me insane
Although you try to fight
Dragged from the silence where you hide
Till you scream
Scream
I can't wait to hear you
I can't wait to hear you
Scream
I can't wait to hear you
I can't wait to hear you
Scream! Scream! Scream!
