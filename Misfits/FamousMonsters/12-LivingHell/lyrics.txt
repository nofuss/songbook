Imprisoned in this world of darkness few have known
A monster lusting blood and the hunger grows

Out on the streets, danger's real, the killer's still at large
A trail of death and sewers to the underground

I fell their fleeting life draw into my bones
Hear the heart that pounds, the blood that flows
Eternity, I damn thee, let me rot into the ground
As the empty veins collapse
Cast them down

Living Hell
I just can't go on...
In this living Hell

This town has worn thin, everybody knows
Panic in the news and the terror grows
A tunnel full of filth, escape into the night
Another hole to dwell in the underground

I feel their fleeting life draw into my bones
Hear the heart that pounds, the blood that flows
Eternity, I damn thee, let me rot into the ground
As the empty veins collapse
Cast them down

Living Hell
I just can't go on...
In this livng Hell
