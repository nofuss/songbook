Torn from the heavens, they fall from the sky
And walk the streets among mortal men
They hide in shadows, keepers of the night

Mortal life is weak, can't hold back the demons
The blood pours as rain and soon you'll be alone

Descending angel, stand by my side
We'll face the night, descending angel
Who guard the gates of Hell just one more night
For in the morning will bring the light

Born and created in the image of a God
The heavens fall no savior has been sent
No one to guide us, alone we face the night

Mortal life is brief for the rebel angels
They make their final stand and soon you'll be alone

Descending angel, stand by my side
And face the night, descending angel
Who guard the gates of Hell just one more night
Forever ends tonight! Descending angel

Descending angel, descending angel, stand by my side
And face the night, descending angel
Who guard the gates of Hell just one more night
Forever ends tonight! Descending angel

[Incomprehensible]
Descending angel
