It's such a steep climb
Up the mountain's south side
It has a cloud that acts
In such peculiar ways

Accident count rising,
A young girl prophesizing
To protect their race
They'll seize her mind

At this altitude it's freezing
Aliens control human beings
No one has lived to tell
Who's seen the crawling eye?

At this altitude it's freezing
Aliens control human beings
No one has lived to tell
Who's seen the crawling eye?

These evil demon eyes,
Under cloud cover hide
They have great tentacles
To tear apart their prey

All these men are dying,
Crawling eye decapitizing
Fiends without a face
Attack mankind

At this altitude it's freezing
Aliens control human beings
No one has lived to tell
Who's seen the crawling eye?

At this altitude it's freezing
Aliens control human beings
No one has lived to tell
Who's seen the crawling eye?

Crawling eye
Crawling eye
Crawling eye
