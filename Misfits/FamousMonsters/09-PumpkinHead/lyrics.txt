Now this is the story
Of a good man named Ed
Left his son for a moment
Returned, found him dead

Recalls a tale as a boy he was told
Of an evil witch, so wicked, so old
Seeks a farmers advice he will not give
His oldest son knows just where the witch lived

He took Ed there but refused to go in
They boy knew what was about to begin
She had the power to avenge the dead
It cost your sould, now come with me Ed

I'm gonna take you where your body will lie
I'm gonna take you there, my friend
I'm gonna show you where your life will end
I'm gonna bring you here again

Dig up your grave, the old lady said
The thing we need lies here dormant, sleeping with the dead
You understand what you ask of me
Not even death can set your soul free

I cast this curse and you will find
An evil darkness deep inside your vengeful mind
God damn you to hell, he could not restrain
He already has son, the witch did explain

I'm gonna take you where your body will lie
I'm take you there, my friend
I'm gonna show you where your life will end
This curse I cast, you're Pumpkinhead!
