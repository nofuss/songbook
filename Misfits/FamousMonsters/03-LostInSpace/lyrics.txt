Of all the things they taught you, I'm telling you this, son
All the wars fought before won't compare to this one
Giant spiders prepare... to take over

Here comes another mutant suicide squad
You blast them out but now you're way off course
You start to shiver and shake
I'm calling you, Houston

Am I following...all of the right leads?
Or am I about to get lost in space?
When my time comes, they'll write my destiny
Will you take this ride?

All communication's lost, we crashed into the Earth
Too late to see a giant spider monster giving birth
The future is here... and here is the future

Am I following... all of the right leads?
Or am I about to get lost in space?
When my time comes, they'll write my destiny
Will you take this ride with me?
