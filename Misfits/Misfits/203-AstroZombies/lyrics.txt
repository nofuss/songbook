Oh, all I want to know
All I want

[Verse 1]
With just a touch of my burning hand
I send my astro zombies to rape this land
Prime directive, exterminate the whole human race
And your face drops in a pile of flesh
And then your heart, heart pounds 'til it pumps in death
Prime directive, exterminate whatever stands left

[Chorus]
All I wanted to say, and all I gotta do
Who'd I do this for? Hey, me or you?
And all I wanted to say, and all I gotta do
Who'd I do this for? Hey, me or you?

[Bridge]
Oh, all I want to know
All I want

[Verse 2]
With just a touch of my burning hand
I'm gonna live my life to destroy your world
Prime directive, exterminate the whole fucking race
Then your face drops in a pile of flesh
And then your heart, heart pounds 'til it pumps in death
Prime directive, exterminate this whole fucking place, well
[Chorus]
All I wanted to say, and all I gotta do
Who'd I do this for? Hey, me or you?
And all I wanted to say, and all I gotta do
Who'd I do this for? Hey, me or you?

[Outro]
Oh, all I want to know
All I want to know
All I want to know
All I want to know!
