Intro]
Two! One, two!
Hey!

[Verse]
Black dress moves in a blue movie
Graverobbers from outer space
Well, your pulmonary trembles in your outstretched arm
Tremble so wicked
Two inch nails
Micro waist
With a pale white feline face
Inclination eyebrows to there
Mistress to the horror kid
Cemetary of the white love ghoul, well
Take off your shabby dress
Come and lay beside me

[Pre-Chorus]
Come a little bit closer
Come a little bit closer
Come a little bit closer
Come a little bit closer to this

[Chorus]
Vampira
Vampira
Vampira
[Outro]
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
