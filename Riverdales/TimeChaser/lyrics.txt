And I wonder if she misses me
Or if she's glad that I'm gone
The word on the street's, you've been dissin' me
For everything that I did wrong
That I did wrong

Ooh-ooh-ooh

I'm a time, time, time, chaser
I wanna go back and make it right
I'm a time, time, time, chaser
I wanna go to that time, when I was happy with you

Ooh-ooh-ooh

I guess you could say I'm still hung up
It feels like lightyears since you left
I'd give you the universe if I could
It came down to something I don't get
That I don't get

Ooh-ooh-ooh

I'm a time, time, time, chaser
I wanna go back and make it right
I'm a time, time, time, chaser, yeah
I wanna go to that time, when I was happy with you

Ooh-ooh-ooh

If I could only build a time machine
Travel through flyin' colors of my dreams
All my dreams comin' true, those dreams of me and you

I'm a time, time, time, chaser
I wanna go back and make it right
I'm a time, time, time, chaser, yeah
I wanna go to that time, when I was happy with you

Ooh-ooh-ooh
Happy with you
Ooh-ooh-ooh

Since my baby left me, I've been livin' in the past
