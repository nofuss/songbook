Here we come, walkin'
Down the street
We get the funniest looks from
Ev'ry one we meet
Hey, hey, we're the Monkees
And people say we monkey around
But we're too busy singing
To put anybody down

We go wherever we want to do
What we like to do
We don't have time to get restless
There's always something new
Hey, hey, we're the Monkees
And people say we monkey around
But we're too busy singing
To put anybody down

We're just tryin' to be friendly
Come and watch us sing and play
We're the young generation
And we've got something to say

Any time, Or anywhere
Just look over your shoulder
Guess who'll be standing there

Hey, hey, we're the Monkees
And people say we monkey around
But we're too busy singing
To put anybody down

[break]

Hey, hey, we're the Monkees
And people say we monkey around
But we're too busy singing
To put anybody down

We're just tryin' to be friendly
Come and watch us sing and play
We're the young generation
And we've got something to say

Hey, hey, we're the Monkees
Hey, hey, we're the Monkees
[repeat and fade]

[Extra verse:]
Hey, hey, we're the Monkees
You never know where we'll be found
So you'd better get ready
We may be comin' to your town
