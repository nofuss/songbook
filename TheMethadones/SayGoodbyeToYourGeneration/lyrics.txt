Can't you see our generation's going down the tubes?
The more we keep looking back we can only lose
Remember when we were kids hanging out?
Feeling alright thinking we're on top?
Well now the whole damn generation's going down the tubes

We sit around and think about what lies ahead
We know there's no going back and it fills us with dread
Remember when we were kids hanging out?
Feeling alright thinking we're on top?
Well now the whole damn generation's going down the tubes

Say goodbye to your generation
I'm left wanting more than what we could do
Say goodbye to your generation
Yeah, that's right I'm talking to you

Say goodbye to your generation
I'm left wanting more than what we could do
Say goodbye to your generation
Soon to be forgotten for something new

We never thought it would ever turn out like this
Every once in a while I can't help feeling pissed
Some of the things we stood for just don't matter anymore

The whole damn generation's going down the tubes
Say goodbye to your generation
