You've got something that you wanna hold over my head
Trying to keep me in line for something wrong I said
Doing anything you can to try to keep me down
Next time I will have to duck when you fire another round

Whoa, look out now
She's got her ammunition
(Ammunition)
Taking cheap shots now with her ammunition
(Ammunition)

You won't let me live down anything
And you're always building a case
I know you really love to try to put me in my place
I tried to apologize, and it was taken at the time
Now it's six months later
And the thought still lingers in your mind

Whoa, look out now
She's got her ammunition
(Ammunition)
Taking cheap shots now with her ammunition
(Ammunition)

Whoa, hit the deck now
Ammunition
(Ammunition)
Whoa, look out now
Oh yeah

Ready, aim, fire!

[Guitar solo]

Whoa, look out now
She's got her ammunition
(Ammunition)
Taking cheap shots now with her ammunition
(Ammunition)

Whoa, hit the deck now
Ammunition
(Ammunition)
Whoa, look out now
Oh yeah

Hey! Hey! Hey!
Ammunition
