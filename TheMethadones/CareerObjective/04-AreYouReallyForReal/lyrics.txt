You'll do anything to
Have all the eyes on you
It's one stupid thing after another
That goes on and on and on and

I can't believe anything you say
I roll my eyes and walk away

Bending over backwards
To get your attention
The more we ignore you
Just makes you want to act up even more

I can't believe anything you say
I roll my eyes and walk away
But you still keep doing anything you feel
Tell me are you really for real?

You made yourself a punch line
From a joke I didn't want to hear
You want us to listen to what you're saying
So you keep coming near

I don't know why it
Matters if we notice you
You are one screwed up individual
With a lot of stupid shit to prove

I can't believe anything you say
I roll my eyes and walk away
But you still keep doing anything you feel
Tell me are you really for real?
