Sometimes I break down and read into things that are not there
I can't convince myself your harmless actions have me without care
I know that I love you, and for my sake as well as yours
I will do what I have to and hopefully find a cure

I tell myself that I must be strong
But there is something I knew all along

I need the antidote
I need the antidote
I need the antidote to regain control
I need the antidote
I need the antidote
I need the antidote to regain control

You had me worried in your letter
Didn't sleep for weeks
Kept thinking it was over
I was just in way too deep
I try my best to see the cup half full and try to smile
Try to accept the past
We are only here for a while

I tell myself that I must be strong
But there is something I knew all along

I need the antidote
I need the antidote
I need the antidote to regain control
I need the antidote
I need the antidote
I need the antidote to regain control

Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
(Control)
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

(I need the antidote)
(Control)
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh
(I need the antidote)
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh
(I need the antidote)
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
(I need the antidote)...
