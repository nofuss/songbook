I sit here waiting for you to acknowledge me
With a greeting or a simple smile
These things I once took for granted
Now go a long way with me
They can make it all worthwhile

I hope you'll listen to what I have to say

You're so far away
Hey hey hey
Now everything turns into a game
You're so far away
Hey hey hey
Even though you're right here next to me
I keep hoping that you'll let me in

Got this sick feeling in my gut that's been lingering for weeks
From the things you have and have not said
Please don't turn away something I find important to me
Should I roll over and play dead?

I hope you'll listen to what I have to say

You're so far away
Hey hey hey
Now everything turns into a game
You're so far away
Hey hey hey
Even though you're right here next to me
I keep hoping that you'll let me in

[Guitar lead]

Hey

You're so far away
Hey hey hey
Now everything turns into a game
You're so far away
Hey hey hey
Even though you're right here next to me
I keep hoping that you'll let me in

You're so far away
You're so far away
You're so far away
So far away
