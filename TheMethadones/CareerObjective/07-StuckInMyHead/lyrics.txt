The other night I couldn't sleep
Thinking 'bout everything and nothing
Were they a bunch of pointless thoughts that repeat
Or were they trying to tell me something?

Everything before me just keeps passing by
I think about everything, and I can't seem to get out of my head
Yeah

Life is short
There's little time
I feel it in my heart everyday
Yet I hardly notice anything
I heard half of what you said

I try to be in the moment
Let things be as they are
But I'm busy making sense of a thousand things
While I'm stuck in my head
Yeah

I'm not getting anywhere
I feel like I'm dead
I've gone full circle just to find
That I am stuck in my head
