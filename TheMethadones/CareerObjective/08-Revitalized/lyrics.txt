You couldn't understand that we didn't, didn't see eye to eye
But when you left me, it really hit me
You're gone
I'm revitalized

You knew how to push all my buttons
Shrink me down to your size
Now I know I'd rather be lonely than have you
I'm revitalized

I'm revitalized

I feel better than I have, I have in quite some time now
I don't feel bitter anymore, and there's no more lies
I'm revitalized

I'm
I'm
I'm revitalized
I'm
I'm
I'm revitalized
