I am on the verge of losing self-control
Pacing through the living room
Ready to put my fist through the wall

Step back, you're in danger, baby
The pressure is too much for me
I need a release
I'm about to

Trying to contain myself
But something's trying to get out
I keep hoping it'll subside
I am filled with doubt

Step back, you're in danger, baby
The pressure is too much for me
I need a release
I'm about to crack

I'm about to crack
I'm about to

It's gonna take a lot of you to strap me down
Nurse Ratchet may take care of me
But I won't wear a hospital gown

Step back, you're in danger, baby
The pressure is too much for me
I need a release
I'm about to crack

I'm about to crack
I'm about to crack
I'm about to crack
I'm about to
