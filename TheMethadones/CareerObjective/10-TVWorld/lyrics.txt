I get tired of thinking of what I don't want to be
I need a career but the thought depresses me
I see commercials for Devry and ITT
But they just make me want to go back to sleep

I just wanna be in my TV world
Not doing anything in my TV world

My girlfriend's disgusted with me
I drink too much and never miss All In The Family
I need to do something but I just don't know what
I'm flipping through the channels and it's driving her nuts

I haven't left the couch for a week
I'm in such a trance that I can hardly speak
I stay in tuned to this warm TV glow these transmitted images are all that I know
