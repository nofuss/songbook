I search for what is right and with everyday I fight
For what I feel needs to be done
The years keep slipping by, I try to get the most out of my life
There are many places I've gone wrong

I've been my worst enemy
Wading through the shit and stink
Turning out incomplete

I was refusing to grow up, paving the road to hell
But still I lived according to my will
I thought of a career objective and I gained a new perspective
Playing punk rock's a non-transferable skill
