I saw you walking down the street
For a second we were eye to eye
There was a flicker of familiarity
As we passed each other by

Well, there was a time that I knew you well
But that was a long, a long time ago

Don't know me anymore
Don't know me anymore
Don't know me anymore
You don't know me anymore
Don't know me anymore
Don't know me anymore
Don't know me anymore
You don't know me anymore

I had to turn my head back and take in this scene again
How did it ever come to this?
The question filled my mind

Well, there was a time that I knew you well
But now I'll just let, let bygones be

Don't know me anymore
Don't know me anymore
Don't know me anymore
You don't know me anymore
Don't know me anymore
Don't know me anymore
Don't know me anymore
You don't know me anymore

I felt like a jerk, yeah, with nothing to say
But what to talk about?
You don't know me anyway

Don't know me anymore
Don't know me anymore
Don't know me anymore
You don't know me anymore
Don't know me anymore
Don't know me anymore
Don't know me anymore
You don't know me anymore

You don't know me now
(Na na na na)
(Na na na na)
(Na na na na na)

Don't know me anymore
(Na na na na)
(Na na na na)
(Na na na na na)...
