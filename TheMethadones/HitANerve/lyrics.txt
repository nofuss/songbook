You asked the question
I gave the answer
and than you were stunned by the words
Shot me this look like you want to kill me It makes no sense to me
I hit a nerve just from replying
I hit a nerve-because I wasn't lying I hit a nerve
Because you don't wanna-don't wanna don't wanna
don't wanna don't wanna hear it again
There was something raw I touched
Slide through the back door ready to implode
I hit a nerve just from replying 
I hit a nerve-because I wasn't lying I hit a nerve
Because you don't wanna-don't wanna don't wanna
Beside yourself like such a fool
live a stupid fantasy but you think I'm cruel
Stories I've heard over again
Ending different like every time before
Why the hell do you set yourself up?
Or do you just forget who you're talking to?
