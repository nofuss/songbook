Laughing man in the devil mask
Laughing man in the devil mask
Laughing man in the devil mask
Laughing man in the devil mask

You ripped yourself to shreds
While I stood laughing
You'd like to see me pay
For the time you're having

You'll walk that line again
You'll try to die again
You'll waste your nights just thinking of me

As the needle finds the vein
As the bullet goes through the brain
As your city meets the sea
As you're drowning, think of me

Laughing man in the devil mask
Laughing man in the devil mask
Laughing man in the devil mask
Laughing man in the devil mask

I am the lord of crime
The laughing man in a devil mask
I am the birth of crime
The laughing man in a devil mask
Drop to your knees again
The laughing man in a devil mask
Tie off and die again
The laughing man in a devil mask

Push the rock back up the hill
You start to feel like you're standing still
Your life lies broken for all to see
You'll hear the laughter, then you'll see me

Laughing man in the devil mask
Laughing man in the devil mask
Laughing man in the devil mask
Laughing man in the devil mask

Tender flock, led astray
You always knew it would be this way
You just go now, no need to ask
You are the face behind the devil mask

The laughing man in the devil mask
Laughing man in the devil mask
I'm laughing, I'm laughing
You're burning, you're burning
The laughing man in the devil mask
The laughing man in the devil mask
Burn, burn
Burn while I'm laughing
