Yesterday I got so old
I felt like I could die
Yesterday I got so old
It made me want to cry

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Go on, go on, just walk away
Go on, go on, your choice is made
Go on, go on, and disappear
Go on, go on away from here

[Chorus]
And I know I was wrong when I said it was true
That it couldn't be me and be her in between
Without you
Without you

[Verse 2]
Yesterday I got so scared
I shivered like a child
Yesterday, away from you
It froze me deep inside

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Come back, come back, don't walk away
Come back, come back, come back today
Come back, come back, why can't you see?
Come back, come back, come back to me

[Chorus]
And I know I was wrong when I said it was true
That it couldn't be me and be her in between without you
Without you
Without you, without you

[Outro]
Without you, without you
Without you, without you
