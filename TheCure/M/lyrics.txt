Hello image
Sing me a line from your favourite song
Twist and turn but you're trapped in the light
All the directions were wrong

[Refrain]
You'll fall in love with somebody else tonight

[Verse 2]
Help yourself
But tell me the words before you fade away
You reveal all the secrets to remember the end
And escape someday

[Refrain]
You'll fall in love with somebody else again tonight

[Verse 3]
Take a step
You move in time but it's always back
The reasons are clear, your face is drawn
And ready for the next attack
