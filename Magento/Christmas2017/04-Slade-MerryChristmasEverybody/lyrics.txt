[Verse 1]
Are you hanging up a stocking on your wall
It's the time that every Santa has a ball
Does he ride a red nosed reindeer
Does a ton-up on his sleigh
Do the fairies keep him sober for a day.

[Chorus]
So here it is Merry Christmas
Everybody's having fun
Look to the future now,
It's only just begun.

[Verse 2]
Are you waiting for the family to arrive
Are you sure you got the room to spare inside
Does your granny always tell ya
That the old songs are the best
Then she's up and rock and rollin' with the rest.

[Chorus]
So here it is Merry Christmas
Everybody's having fun
Look to the future now
It's only just begun.

[Bridge]
What will your daddy do when he sees
Your mama kissin' Santa Claus
Ah ah

[Verse 3]
Are you hanging up a stocking on your wall
Are you hoping that the snow will start to fall
Do you ride on down the hillside
In a buggy you have made
When you land upon your head
Then you been slayed.

[Chorus]
So here it is Merry Christmas
Everybody's having fun
Look to the future now
It's only just begun.

[Chorus]
So here it is Merry Christmas
Everybody's having fun
Look to the future now
It's only just begun.

[Chorus]
So here it is Merry Christmas
Everybody's having fun
Look to the future now
It's only just begun.
