I want you so hard
I want you so good
But can you trust me?
Yes, you know, you could
My friends are talkin'
And they're tellin' you

Don't waste your time
'Cause the boy's bad news

My friends are talkin'
And they're tellin' you
Just leave him alone
'Cause the boy's bad news

I want you so hard
I want you so good
Now take a chance, momma
You know, you should
Trust your instincts and let me in
Just be my ride and I'll be my friend

My friends are talkin'
And they're tellin' you

You're wastin' your time
The boy's bad news

My friends are talkin'
And they're tellin' you
Leave him alone
'Cause it's just bad news

I want you so hard
I want you so good
But can you trust me?
Yes, you know, you could
Trust your instincts and let me in
Just be my ride and I'll be my friend

My friends are talkin'
And they're tellin' you

You're wastin' your time
'Cause the boy's bad news

My friends are talkin'
And they're tellin' you
Just leave him alone
'Cause the boy's bad news

Bad news

The boy's bad news
The boy's bad news
The boy's bad news
The boy's bad news

The boy's bad news
The boy's bad news
The boy's bad news
The boy's bad news

The boy's bad news
The boy's bad news
The boy's bad news
The boy's bad news
