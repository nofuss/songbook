You know I try so hard
But I think you don't see
'Cause' I'm moving so fast
We call it rock n rollin'
My weapon seems usless
'Cause' your on to me
You are impossible to read
You're always straight controllin'

Oh oh oh Miss Allisa!
Oh oh oh Miss Allisa!
Oh oh oh Miss Allisa!
Gon' doo a voodoo until
You feel my power now!

You know I feel so smooth
I'm always struttin' when in motion
Make the little girls dance
'Cause' I'm rock n rollin'
It really doesn't matter
If you're hard to please
'Cause' when you give me your smile
I'm yours for straight controllin'

Oh oh oh Miss Allisa!
Oh oh oh Miss Allisa!
Oh oh oh Miss Allisa!
Gon' doo a voodoo until
You feel my power now!

You know I try so hard
But I think you don't see
'Cause' I'm moving so fast
We call it rock n rollin'
My weapon seems usless
'Cause' your on to me
You are impossible to read
You're always straight controllin'

Oh oh oh Miss Allisa!
Oh oh oh Miss Allisa!
Oh oh oh Miss Allisa!
Gon' doo a voodoo until
You feel my power now!

Oh oh oh Miss Allisa!
Oh oh oh Miss Allisa!
Oh oh oh Miss Allisa!
Oh oh oh Miss Allisa!
Gon' doo a voodoo until
You feel my power now!
