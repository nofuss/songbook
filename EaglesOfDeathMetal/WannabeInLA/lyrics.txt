I came to L.A. to make rock and roll
Along the way I had to sell my soul
I made some good friends that make me say
I really wannabe in L.A.

I took the 10 to get to Beverly
Laid some rock to tape roll on the 180
Alain and Natasha always make me say
I really wannabe in L.A.

I really wannabe in L.A., ohh
I really wannabe in L.A., ohh
I really wannabe in L.A., ohh

I take the city in the dead of night
I'm burning gas until I feel alright
My Sunset honeys always make me say
I really wannabe in L.A.

I came to L.A. to make rock 'n' roll
Along the way I had to sell my soul
I made some good friends that make me say
I really wannabe in L.A.
I really wannabe in L.A.
I really wannabe, really wannabe, really wannabe in L.A.
