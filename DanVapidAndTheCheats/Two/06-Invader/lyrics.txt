Invader of my dreams
how do I get you out of me?
you come in many forms high and low
Invader of my dreams
is insidious and mean
after midnight you begin to grow
(Chorus)
and when I go to sleep tonight-will you be waiting for me?
waiting for me? waiting waiting waiting waiting for me?

Invader of my dreams

is on the other team
and keeps showing up to drag me down
with the fallen night
is when you start to bite
like bed bugs hatching in my mind
(Chorus)
and when i go to sleep tonight will you be waiting for me?
waiting for me? waiting waiting waiting waiting for me?
