If you're not happy you should go
it's really that easy, you know.
But I know that you will miss this
but if you're not happy you should go
(Chorus)
I don't have the answer why
are you afraid of what you'll find?
If you're not happy you should go
If you're not happy you should go

I don't want to stand in your way

I find all you do is complain
If you're over it - done - not having any fun
just call it day
(Chorus)
I don't have the answer why
are you afraid of what you'll find?
If you're not happy you should go
If you're not happy you should go
