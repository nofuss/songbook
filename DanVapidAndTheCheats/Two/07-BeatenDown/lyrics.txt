I feel so beaten down
I feel so beaten down

I feel so beaten down
I feel so beaten down

I sit here wondering if it ever gets better
what's so grossly unfair
as it rains - keeps raining in my head

I feel so beaten down
I feel so beaten down

had to stop watching the news and turn off my TV
just couldn't take anymore of a senseless tragedy
I start giving up on humanity
(Lead)
Through painful soul searching the answers are complex
so much random suffering we must learn to accept
living in a world that's such a fucking mess

I feel so beaten down
I feel so beaten down
