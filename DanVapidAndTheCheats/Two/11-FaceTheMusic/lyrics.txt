You were like Hannibal Lector and I like Agent Starling
just a little afraid while trying to probe your brain
but you were out of your cell-unleashing hell one night
-letting out that part of you insane
it's time - time - time - time - it's
(Chorus)

time to Face the Music
how will you explain?
when it's time to face the music
you will spin what you can

Play down your bullshit-turn it around on me-

then try to eat my liver with some Fava Beans and a nice Chianti
you might have a high IQ but still a lot of twisted shit to prove
now unleashed for the world to see
it's time - time - time - time - it's

When it's time to face the music
I know how you'll explain
when it's time to face the music
you will spin what you can
