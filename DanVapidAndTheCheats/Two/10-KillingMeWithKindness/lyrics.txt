I was brooding in the bar after our set
drinking and trying to forget about an off night
that had just occurred
you told me about a song that got you through hard times
and it just so happened to be one of mine
and I smiled unsure of what to say-and just said thanks
(Chorus)
you're killing me with kindness
embarrassed just a little still i'm glad to say
you're killing me with kindness
happy that you feel that way

Suddenly I became intrigued
as I really thought you were just messing with me
before I knew that you were serious
shaking my hand not letting it go
singing that line going whoa-oh-oh
from a song from so long ago
(Chorus)
you're killing me with kindness

embarrassed just a little still i'm glad to say
you're killing me with kindness
happy that you feel that way

and your air guitar really cracked me up
all those downstroke chops were done out of love
I felt lucky to have touched someone in such a way
without knowing it, you cheered me up, by giving a shit and being there

you're killing me kindness
embarrassed just a little still glad to say
you're killing me with kindness
Happy that you feel that way
Happy that you feel that way
so happy that you feel - so happy that you feel that way
Killing me with kindness
