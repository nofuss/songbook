Writhing and embraced,
Retribution, soul eclipse turns solid,
Energized, sucking vomit - acting like it's honey;
Deprived of I,
Falling while thrusting squares through circles,
Serving one single new dimension.
Terror rising, agnostics nemesis, a prophet of extinction.

I scorch the skies before your very eyes,
My deliverance - enslavement labelled: love.

Just trust this nemesis to sign and seal extinction.
