Meshuggah

Break Those Bones Whose Sinews Gave It Motion

Songwriters: THORDENDAL, FREDRIK / KIDMAN, JENS / HAGSTROEM, MAARTEN / HAAKE, TOMAS / LOEVGREN, DICK AUGUST

Tremors, reverberating frequency of doom
How strongly the violent thoughts of vengeance echo
Setting in motion the strings of hate
Shudder. Shudder. Vibrate.

This is the soundtrack to our hostility,
To our malicious intent, to the pointless grudge forever held,
The callow dream, the dismal wish to harm.

Animate now the twisted sounds of our disdain, our rage
The notations to our contempt, to unforgiveness and loathing

A sonic declaration of spite and resentment
It's resonance grinding to dust our souls
The twine of revenge tightly strung.
It's subharmonics the undoing of all

So enticing, the retaliation - chords of man
The all-deafening oscillation of the damned.

Let forth the hateful, the murderous
Let their malignant prayers resound
The reverbant odious request, the wish of death abound.

So enticing, the retaliation - chords of man
The all-deafening oscillation of the damned.
