Well there's a creep in the cellar that I'm gonna let in
And he eats in the alley and keeps track of my sins
When he starts talking backwards your head starts to spin
And he really freaks me out when he peels off his skin

Well there's a creep in the cellar that I'm gonna let in
There's a hole in his brain where his mind should have to be
When he start rubbing wrinkles he gets pretty fat
when he starts talking nickelback, diamondback, Muscleback

Well there's a creep in the cellar with his hands in the air
And he lies to his mother but she doesn't care
Well the fish are flying backwards we all just stare
Like the turkeys talking Backwards

Well there's a creep in the cellar that I' am going to let in

Oh there's a creep in the cellar that I'm gonna let in
There's a hole in his brain where his mind should've been
When he starts talkin' backwards your head starts to spin
And he really freaks me out when he peels off his skin, yow!

Oh there's a creep in the cellar with his hands in the air
And he lies to his mother but she doesn't care
When the fists are flying backwards and the ballroom is bare
Cause the turkey's talkin' backwards, it'll raise up your hair

Oh there's a creep in the cellar that I'm gonna let...in
