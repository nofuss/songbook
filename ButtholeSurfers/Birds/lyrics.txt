Alright what are we doing here? Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha
AaaaAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!
You're workin and you already stinks like a finger
Roller Coaster lovely hair
You wanna pop a bubble out you know it's only trouble
Cause you think that no one better can care
Wham bam it's a scam you're the man we're your friends
We go nothin' better to say
So we make our only choices that reminded you of voices
They say that nothin's really better today
I wanna hide, wanna be unknown
If I can't decide, I'll get it on my own
Say you got a leak you know the reason I want a bitch
Said the plais room that are leaving you scared
You're steady and your eye when you're tryin' seein' double
And you never know the places you've been
Can't see it can you hear real trip dine on air
Well something's ready better than they are
We couldn't tell it wanted and it almost broke my heart a situation like just a fair
You can never do anything that's never been done before
You can try a different style but you'll end up on the side of the floor, wasted
Instead of tryin' East and wide redifinded Thinkin' of
We got nothin better to say
Stand out in the gutter we would call a number time and then get a feelin' go away
Oh what hate, wanna be unknown
If I can't decide, I'll get it on my own
Tired of my own You know we like your sisters keep it like a movie in Maine
She calls at my gun and she leaves me at the bind the she's runnin'
I should clear the way
Wham bam it's a scam you're the man we're your friends
We got nothin' better to say
So we make our only choices with our minds and make our voices says that nothin's really better today

You can never do anything that's never been done before
You can try, a different style, but you always end up on the floor, wasted


lright what are we doing here?

You're looking at your arm, it stings like a bee now
Rollercoaster up in the air
You wanna pop a bubble but you know it's only trouble
'cuz you think that no one better would care
Wham, bam, it's a scam, no demand, we got plans
We got nothin' better to say
So we make our only choices that reminded you of voices
Sayin' that nothin's really better today

I wanna hide, wanna be alone
And if I can't decide I get it on my own

Shakin' like a leaf you know the reason I wanna be
The sacrifices that'll live in your skin
You're steady and you're hollow when you started seein' double
And you never know the places you been
Can't sit, take a hit, we got tipped, I got it
A substance that is better than air
We couldn't tell apart and it almost broke my heart
The situation, well it just wasn't fair

You can never do anything that's never been done before
You can try a different style, but you'll end up the same as before
Wasted

Seven side, east and wide, you go by, day and night
We got nothin' better all day
Stand out in the yard and you would kinda look retarded
Make a feeling, get a feeling, go away

I wanna hide, wanna be alone
And if I can't decide I get it on my own

Tired on my own you know they like a resistance
Even I'm a movie star fan
She got within my car and then she leaves me at the bar
And makes me cry and make up the other way

Wham, bam, it's a scam, no demand, we got plans
We got nothin' better to say
So we make our only choices, make our minds and make our voices change
And nothin's really different today

You can never do anything that's never been done before
You can try a different style but you always end up on the floor

Wasted
