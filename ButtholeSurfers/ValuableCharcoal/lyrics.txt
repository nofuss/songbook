for about a year when I was twelve years old
I was visited by a girl who I saw as a ghost
floating the room in a foreign car
driving by me on the street

I saw the passing car
in the hissing rain
your mother was beside you
somehow your face was mine

or as a girl I met in North Carolina 
while on vacation with my parents
she'd met another boy the day before I met her
and he was a lot like me
we shared the same birthday but he was a year older than I

I shot the sheriff
I shot the deputy
I shot off my mouth and my body went south
on a calmy waving sea

psychedelia

last time I saw you
we were down by the creak
just for fun you took your shirt off
it wasn't right for me
so I ran back to my bike and rode
to a place that felt good to me

I was in the bedroom and 
then you then walked right in
you disappeared across the street
I never saw you again, again, again
