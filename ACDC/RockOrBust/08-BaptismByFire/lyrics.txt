Let's get the party started
And baby, do your tricks, ooh
Let's get the joint a-jumping
The boys need their kicks

We're gonna shock the nation
Make 'em flip their lids
You know you need a vacation
Ooh, bring along a bottle and enjoy the trip

I said ride, ride, ride
Up all night
Ride
It'll blow your mind

Baptism by fire
Don't let them roll the tires
Baptism by fire
You start the burning wire

Play your hand
Come on and make a stand, hey

You hear the crack of thunder
Or feel the lightning strike, hey
You get your pistons firing
It's Lady Fortune's night

Ride, ride, ride
Up all night
Ride
It'll blow your mind

Baptism by fire
Don't let them roll the tires
Baptism by fire
You feel the burning wire
Baptism by fire
Shooting high and shooting higher

Play your hand
Come on and play your hand
And let me show you how
Come on and make a stand

It'll blow your mind
Baptism by fire
Sweet, sweet desire
Baptism by fire
You're gonna burn wire
Baptism by fire
Shooting high and shooting higher, yeah
