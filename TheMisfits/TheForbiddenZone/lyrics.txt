Some say that's where man began
On this wasted piece of land 
Where evolution's yet to show
(Forbidden zone)

Blasting into outer space
The planet of the apes 
Evolution's one hero

Crossing a plain, into another dimension
A million years into the future
Crossing a path into another dimension
We the unseen

Back on earth it's all you read about
All the evidence destroyed
Maps and legends mark the firewalls
We, the lost abandoned saviors
Of the forbidden zone

Some say that's where man began
On this wasted piece of land 
Where evolution's yet to show
(Forbidden zone)
Blasting into outer space
The planet of the apes
Evolution's one hero

Crossing a plain, into another dimension
A million years into the future
Crossing a path into another dimension
We the unseen

Back on earth it's all you read about
All the evidence destroyed
Maps and legends mark the firewalls
We, the lost abandoned saviors

Back on earth it's all you read about
All the evidence destroyed
Maps and legends mark the firewalls
We, the lost abandoned saviors

We shall sustain the forbidden zone
The forbidden zone, the forbidden zone

Blasting into outer space
The planet of the apes
Evolution's one hero
(Forbidden zone)
