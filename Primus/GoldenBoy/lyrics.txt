He was a might golden boy as gold as ever seen 
But when he stepped up to the podium, you could tell that boy was mean 

His arms was made of nickel, his forehead made of wood 
An affidavit from the principal says, "This boy just ain't no good" 

Ain't no good 

He stood before the union, he made a solemn oath 
Uphold the purity of his creed and the others he would toast 
He worked nights at the liquor mart; he drank to pad his pay 
When caught him liftin' 40's, he shot a boy last May 

His momma asked why? 

I don't know 

His lawyer in the courtroom made a noble plea 
The judge he gave him eighteen months but he was out in three 
When asked if he ever felt remorse while sittin' up in that pen 
He said "Hell no, ye know a thief's a thief and I'd shoot the that fucker again, yes I would" 

His momma asked why? 

His momma asked why?
