Taunted by visions
Plagued by the gospel
Jesus unrisen
Christ, he's never there, and I'm
Trapped in his prison
Labeled "unwanted"
Left unforsaken
I wish I was dead

When I woke from god, I gave my heart to blasphemy
Burning in Hell ever more till the end of eternity

Curse of creation
Born to defy you
Symbol of Satan carved into my head, axed from my heart
Nothing to no one
Silent and empty
Withered and wicked
Die, never confess

And you came to me like prophecy and set me free
Freeing myself from the guilt of a world in agony
No longer bound by the words of a lord who canceled me
Severed my soul from his cross and embraced my destiny
