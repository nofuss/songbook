As the believers fall
And blood covers the earth
End of Christianity
Denying his rebirth
Destroying sacred temples
Cast down into the dead
Your meaningless existence
Insignificant

Reign, chaos, mass worship
Prepare the rise of Satan
End Heaven, gods befall
Angels, they reek of torture
Done with Christ
His book is bleeding
End his life
The light defeated

Gathering the godless
Ancient and forgotten
Seeking the creator
Total desecration
Servitude of Satan
Killing his creation

Religion is the answer
If the question is disease
A plague upon mankind
No one waiting when you die
Ending is upon them
No one waiting on his word
Servitude of Satan
In my time upon the earth

Done with Christ
End his life
The light defeated

Done with Christ
His book is bleeding
End his life
The light defeated
Done with Christ
His book is bleeding
End his life
The light defeated
