Servants of death, enchanter of pain
From the land of no return, you'll kill again
Smear the blood on naked corpse
Manson

(Chorus:)
Lunatic of God's creation
No resist
Hear the voices of devastation

There is darkness in his eyes
And you won't see it, before you die
Feel the knife of the Lord Divine's
Creation
