In the creation of Anu were spawned
Born of the Earth before they're known
Evade destruction in their world below
Their hands reach for our place outside
Bestow their suffering on human life
Nothing will stop them from re-entering
Return to hatred in the heart of man

They are the children of the underworld
Before the heavens they were on the Earth
To desolation and were never heard
"Cry rebirth"
Lords of the plague, seven are they
Born in the mountain of Mashu's magic
Spirits of hate, they have no name
Withered and wicked, the liars in wait

In the creation of Anu were spawned
With deadly vengeance from the ancient gods
Their place on Earth, their race unknown
Beyond the knowledge of the elder ones
Provoking with our blood to rise
The seven offspring for the sacrifice
Reclaim the power of the crown of death
Enter the body from the temple dead
