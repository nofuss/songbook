Shunned from the light
Born into darkness never knowing
Infant enshrined
Spawn of the alter, crush mankind

Never will they see you lurking in my shadow
Unbenign the hands of god
Nummified existence, knower of the wicked
Prophesizing flesh of me
Daemon call thee ancient, travel unto Satan
Bring a forth the blood red sea

Evil seed, injected
Daemon freed, the calling
Demon Lord, master
Satan spawn, the Caco-Daemon

Satan spawn, the Caco-Daemon
Satan spawn, the Caco-Daemon
Satan spawn, the Caco-Daemon
Satan spawn, the Caco-Daemon

Pulled back through time
Existence of god you're never knowing
Evil unwind
Exit the womb, your life is mine

Never will they see you lurking in my shadow
Unbenign the hands of god
Nummified existence, knower of the wicked
Prophesizing flesh of me
Daemon call thee ancient, travel unto Satan
Bring a forth the blood red sea

Evil seed, injected
Daemon freed, the calling
Demon Lord, master
Satan spawn, the Caco-Daemon

Satan spawn, the Caco-Daemon
Satan spawn, the Caco-Daemon
Satan spawn, the Caco-Daemon
Satan spawn, the Caco-Daemon
