Time has imprisoned on my soul
Religion in the path of what compels me
Lies instrument the holy hate
Deceiving of the weak in faith intention
Suffering with no reason and nodoubt
Pertruding on the lines of persecution
Vomit on the holy man never before your saviour

Brain dead victims of the holy
Preach your holy lies
Laugh at divinations and we all will be dead
Inscripted is you who will die
Hypocratic bible puncher
Perish from thisland
Faithinized victims of the kingdom of hatred
Infecting this world with their plan

Before none I shall confess
From a far nor heaven sent
Cursed are the lambs of god

Brain dead victims of the holy
Preach your holy lies
Laugh at divinations and we all will be dead

Inscripted is you who will die
Hypocratic bible puncher
Perish from thisland
Faithinized victims of the kingdom of hatred
Infecting this world with their plan

Time has imprisoned on my soul
Religion in the path of what compels me
Lies instrument the holy hate
Deceiving of the weak in faith intention
Suffering with no reason and no doubt
Pertruding on the lines of persecution
Vomit on the holy man never before your saviour
