[Verse 1]
Yet another proposition I don't want this anymore
I'm getting away, getting away myself
In this breeding game I see no point and I don't want to score
This prison made, prison made myself

[Chorus]
Here Come the Robots

[Verse 2]
Yet another resolution still don't want this anymore
I'm getting away, getting away myself
In this breeding game I lost control and I don't want to score
This prison made, prison made myself

[Chorus]
Here Come the Robots
