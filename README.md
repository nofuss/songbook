This is my personal collection of songs that I work on in my modest dream of becoming a competent guitarist. I started a bit late in life on guitar, so my dream is indeed modest.

Most files in this collection are working notes and ocassionaly source resources. In other words, most files will not be terribly interesting to most people.

The Composites directory generally contains the guitar tabs plus lyrics that I have found useful in working out songs. These composite files are what I print out in order to practice, and are probably the most interesting for other people.

The guitar tab notation is roughly accurate in terms of rhythm. That is, the width of a quarter, eight or sixteenth note will be consistent in the tabs. Obviously this convention is not ideal for all music, but for learning songs, I have found it helpful.

In the bin directory, there is a getComposites.pl Perl script, which simple searches the working directories for any file named composite.txt, and copies it to the Composites directory, using the the path the file for the name.

Anyone who find use in this little collection, good for you!
