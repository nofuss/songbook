[Verse 1]
Well, I'm so above you and it's plain to see
But I came to love you anyway
So you pulled my heart out and I don't mind bleedin'
Any old time you keep me waitin', waitin', waitin'

[Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh, oh
I got a love that keeps me waiting
Oh, oh, oh
I got a love that keeps me waiting
I'm a lonely boy
I'm a lonely boy
Oh, oh, oh, oh
I got a love that keeps me waiting

[Verse 2]
Well, your mama kept you, but your daddy left you
And I shoulda done you just the same
But I came to love you, am I born to bleed?
Any old time you keep me waitin', waitin', waitin'

[Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh, oh
I got a love that keeps me waiting
Oh, oh, oh
I got a love that keeps me waiting
I'm a lonely boy
I'm a lonely boy
Oh, oh, oh, oh
I got a love that keeps me waiting (Hey)
[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh, oh
I got a love that keeps me waiting
Oh, oh, oh
I got a love that keeps me waiting
I'm a lonely boy
I'm a lonely boy
Oh, oh, oh, oh
I got a love that keeps me waiting
