Starlight time the sun went down,
The moon is rising through the trees,
Throughout the dark the scene is set,
Trick or treat it's Halloween,

The kids all got their costumes on,
Well I've got mine on too,
Just escaped from the looney bin,
I'm coming after you,

Cause I-I-I-I-I-I-I got murder on my,
Mi-i-i-i-i-ind got murder on my,
Mi-i-i-i-i-ind got murder on my,
Mi-i-i-i-i-ind got murder on my mind,

Take my time it makes it fun,
That's why I don't use a gun,
Gunny sack upon my head,
I won't stop until you're dead,
