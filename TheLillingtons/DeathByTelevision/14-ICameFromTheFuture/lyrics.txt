I came from the future on easy street
I'm a big malt liquor in the seat
all my illusions are one of kind
now everybody and every mind


I came from the future...
[something something something]
[something something something]
[something something something]

And you, you know it's true
And you, don't have a clue

I came from the future...
[something something something]
[something something something]
[something something something]

And you, you know it's true
And you, don't have a clue

A I
I was created by you
I was created by you
I was created by you
I was created by you
