came from the future from the TV screen
I am a being unlike you've ever seen
I'm on a mission and it's one of a kind
I'm not here for your body I am here for your mind

and you, you know it's true
and you, don't have a clue

came from the future from the TV screen
I am a being unlike you've ever seen
I'm on a mission and it's one of a kind
I'm not here for your body I am here for your mind

and you, you know it's true
and you, don't have a clue

and I
I was created by you
I was created by you
I was created by you
I was created by you
