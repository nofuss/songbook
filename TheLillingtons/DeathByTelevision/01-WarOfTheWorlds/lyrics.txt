War of the worlds
It's all coming down
Laser beams and Bombs
Are the only sound
Flying silver discs
Coming from the sky
They wanna kill us all
They wanna see us die
Man or machine
They came from outer space
Programmed to search and
Destroy the master race

War of the Worlds
We're all gonna die 
War of the Worlds
We're all gonna die 
War of the Worlds
We're all gonna die 
War of the Worlds
We're all gonna die
