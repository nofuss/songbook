Don't wanna go to work today
Don't wanna go to work at all
I don't wanna punch the clock
I just wanna punch the wall
Well I'm gonna take a walk
Gonna leave it all behind
Well I've gotta clear my head
Before you brainwash my mind

And I don't wanna end up
Don't wanna end up like the robots in my,
And I don't wanna end up
Don't wanna end up like the robots in my dreams

Don't wanna go to work today
Don't wanna go to work at all
I don't wanna punch the clock
I just wanna punch the wall
Well I've gotta take a walk
Gonna leave it all behind
Well I've gotta clear my head
Before you brainwash my mind

And I don't wanna end up (I don't wanna,)
Don't wanna end up like the robots in my,
I don't wanna end up (I don't wanna,)
Don't wanna end up like the robots in my dreams

We're all gonna end up
We're gonna end up like the robots in our,
We're all gonna end up
We're gonna end up like the robots in our dreams
