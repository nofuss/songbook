I saw the apeman, walking on the moon
I saw the apeman, walking on the moon
I saw the apeman, he’s lookin’ fine
I saw the apeman, drinking turpentine

Put him the rocket, put him on the blimp
Send the apeman up instead of the chimp

I saw the apeman, walking on the moon
I saw the apeman, walking on the moon
I saw the apeman, he’s lookin’ fine
I saw the apeman, drinking turpentine

Put him the rocket, put him on the blimp
Send the apeman up instead of the chimp

I saw the apeman, walking on the moon
I saw the apeman, walking on the moon
I saw the apeman, he’s havin’ a bad day
Because Neil Armstrong, took his banana away

Put him the rocket, put him on the blimp
Send the apeman up instead of the chimp
Put him the rocket, put him on the blimp
Send the apeman up instead of the chimp


I saw the apeman
I saw the apeman on the moon
I saw the apeman
I saw the apeman on the moon

I saw the apeman
I saw the apeman on the moon
I saw the apeman
I saw the apeman on the moon
