Call me Atouk
Like to eat ool
I'll zugzug Lana
Then I'll be cool

Yeah my friend Lar
Went down the river
When he got to the end
He started to shiver

[Chorus:]
Just call me caveman
Just call me caveman
Hit you in the head with my club
[x2]

Call me Atouk
Like to eat ool
I'll zugzug Lana
Then I'll be cool

Yeah my friend Lar
Went down the river
When he got to the end
He started to shiver

[Chorus:]
Just call me caveman
Just call me caveman
Hit you in the head with my club
[x2]
