Don't wanna wake up at 6:15
Don't wanna go to work at the Dairy Queen
Don't wanna watch TV
Don't wanna read
There's only one thing that I really need
I need some brain damage and I need it fast
Beat me till you put me in a body cast

There's only one thing that I really need
Baby give me bruises and make me bleed
I'm feeling unsituated
I'm gonna bang my head head against a wall
Till my brain's become inflated
And I can't even think at all
I'm feeling sort of agitated
Give me some assault and battery
Do I need medicated?
Do I need surgery?
[x3]

Do I need surgery?
Do I need surgery
So I don't swallow my tongue?
