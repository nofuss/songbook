They used to call me Captain Scott
I used to be an astronaut
Put me on a rocket into space
And now I'm lost without a trace

And now I'm really out of sight
And now nothings gonna be alright yeah
My life has been a waste of time
I've got a black hole in my mind [4x]

[2x]

In my mind

My life has waste of time
I've got a black hole in mind [4x]

Mind, I've got a black hole in my mind [4x]
