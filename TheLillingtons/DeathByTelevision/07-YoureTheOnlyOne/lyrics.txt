Was it you?
The movies on tv
You mess me up
Now I can’t even get to sleep
And when I get up
About a quarter to two
You know I’m
Gonna spend another 30 minutes with you

Cuz all the girls in my town, whoa
They don’t have a clue
And none of them can compare to you

Cuz you’re the only one, the only girl for me
You’re the only one, the only girl for me
You’re the only one, the only girl for me
You’re the only one, the only girl for me
