yeah!

the devil hides in nefarious eyes
she showed me legs, and she told me some lies
I wanna do her, oh yeah it's on

she licks my neck like a cat drinks her milk
she's the devil dressed in silk
I gonna do her, oh yeah it's on

can you see her eyes are glowin'
can you feel her getting wild

she pushed me down on a bed of thorns
pierces my soul with her horns
oh yeah, sweet thing it's on

she loved me like lady Godiva
wicked wish with sweet saliva
oh yeah, sweet thing it's on

can you see her eyes are glowin'
can you feel her getting wild

can you see her teeth are showin'
do you know, she's the devil's child

yeah!

can you see her eyes are glowin'
can you feel her being wild

can you see her teeth are showin'
do you know, she's the devil's child
