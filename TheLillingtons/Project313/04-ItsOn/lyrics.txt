yeah!

the devil hides in a [ug]

she showed me legs
she told me some lies
I wanna do her oh yeah it's on

she lifts her neck but you can't drink the milk
she's the devil but dressed in silk
I gonna do her oh yeah it's on

can you see her eyes are glowing
can you feel here getting wild
can you see her teeth are showing
do you know she's the devil's child

she pushed me down on a bed of thorns
this is my song with her horns
oh yeah it's on

she loved me like lady Godiva
makin' a wish with saliva
oh yeah it's on
