yeah!

the devil hides in nefarious eyes
she showed me legs, she told me some lies
I wanna do her, oh yeah it's on

she lifts her neck like a cat drinks her milk
she's the devil dressed in silk
I gonna do her, oh yeah it's on

can you see her eyes are glowing
can you feel here getting wild

she pushed me down on a bed of thorns
dismissed my soul with her horns
oh yeah, sweet thing it's on

she loved me like lady Godiva
wicked wish with sweet saliva
oh yeah, sweet thing it's on

can you see her eyes are glowing
can you feel here getting wild

can you see her teeth are showing
do you know, she's the devil's child

yeah!

can you see her eyes are glowing
can you feel here being wild

can you see her teeth are showing
do you know, she's the devil's child
