I think something might be wrong
'cause it's been dark out far too long
and it's been raining every day
I wanna wish it all away
wish it away

I've got a hole here in my heart
I think it's been there from the start
there's gotta be a better way
I wish it'd all just go away

until the sun shines
until the day breaks


until the sun shines
until the day breaks
until the sun shines
until the day breaks

until the sun shines
until the day breaks
until the sun shines
until the day breaks

in the sunshine
