I'm going on a permanent holiday
Rubber room
No more job no more bills to pay
Rubber room, rubber room

I take my pills gonna feel OK
Rubber room
I get to sit around and dream all day
Rubber room, rubber room

I should have done this back in ninety-three
But life went by me living mine got pain
I want electroshock therapy tonight

I don't worry about a thing no more
Rubber room
I can take a shit in the middle of the floor
Rubber room, rubber room
Run around the game-room like a chimpanzee
Rubber room
Talk about my problems in group therapy
Rubber room, rubber room

I should have done this back in ninety-three
But life went by me living my own pain
I want electroshock therapy tonight

Rubber rubber, rubber rubber, rubber rubber, rubber rubber room
Rubber rubber, rubber rubber, rubber rubber, rubber rubber room

Rubber rubber, rubber rubber, rubber rubber, rubber rubber room
Rubber rubber, rubber rubber, rubber rubber, rubber rubber room

Rubber rubber, rubber rubber, rubber rubber, rubber rubber room
Rubber rubber, rubber rubber, rubber rubber, rubber rubber room

Rubber rubber, rubber rubber, rubber rubber, rubber rubber room
Rubber rubber, rubber rubber, rubber rubber, rubber rubber room
