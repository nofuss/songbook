I'm going on a permanent holiday - rubber room
no more job no more bills to pay - rubber room, rubber room
I take my pills gonna feel ok           - rubber room
I get to sit around and dream all day - rubber room, rubber room

I should have done this back in ninety-three
but life went by me living mine got pain
I want electroshock therapy tonight

I don't worry about a thing no more - rubber room
I can take a shit in the middle of the floor - rubber room, rubber room
run around the gameroom like a chimpazee - rubber room
talk about my problems in group therapy - rubber room, rubber room

I should have done this back in ninety-three
but life went by me living my own pain
I want electroshock therapy tonight

rubber rubber, rubber rubber, rubber rubber, rubber rubber room
rubber rubber, rubber rubber, rubber rubber, rubber rubber room
rubber rubber, rubber rubber, rubber rubber, rubber rubber room
