it's project three-one-three
on a rocket they sent me
out in space that's where it all went wrong

it's project three-one-three
on a rocket they sent me
and I've been gone now far too long

I've been out here here all alone
no T.V. shows no telephone
I got so bored I wrote this tune
wish they would've sent me to the moon

it's project three-one-three
it's not the place to be
'cause now this rocket is my home

writing letters I can't send
E.T. is my best friend
looks like we're doomed to die alone
