It's project three-one-three
On a rocket they sent me
Out in space that's where it all went wrong

It's project three-one-three
On a rocket they sent me
And I've been gone now far too long

I've been out here here all alone
No T.V. shows no telephone
I got so bored I wrote this tune
Wish they would've sent me to the moon

It's project three-one-three
It's not the place to be
'Cause now this rocket is my home

Writing letters I can't send
E.T. is my best friend
Looks like we're doomed to die alone

I've been out here here all alone
No T.V. shows no telephone
I got so bored I wrote this tune
Wish they would've sent me to the moon
