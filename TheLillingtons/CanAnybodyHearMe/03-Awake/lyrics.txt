Endless competition is this life that we have made
My neighbors and my friends are all caught up in the charade
In the morning they'll awake just to face another day
Another night, another day, they're all the same

I'm so restless, never content
How much more can I take?
Every night I think of ending this, each time a different way
But in the morning I'll awake just to face another day
Sometimes I wish it would all fade away

In thе morning I'll awake just to face another day
Anothеr night, another day, they're all the same
In the morning I'll awake just to face another day
Sometimes I wish it would all fade away
