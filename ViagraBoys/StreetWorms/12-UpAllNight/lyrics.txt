I've been up all night
'cause I've been buildin' a machine
I couldn't get the Nobel Prize
For modern engineerin'
Soldered two wires to my brain
And I plugged it to a screen
Well I don't want to scare you
But you won't like what you see

I've been awake for nearly a week
And I don't want to sleep
Until my eyes begin to bleed
Been up all night
I'm up all night
Been up all night
I've been up all night
I replaced my eyelids with a couple LEDs
They don't need no power
They don't need no batteries
They run off a special mix
Of my brainwaves and amphetamine
Yeah, I've been up all night
'cause I've been buildin' a machine, man

I've been awake for nearly a week
And I don't want to sleep
Until my eyes begin to bleed
Been up all night
I'm up all night
I'm up all night
I'm up all night

(Spoken)
(I...I...I can't...I can't see you right now baby
I'm..I'm a little...uh...I've been up all night
I'm buildin' a machine and I mean
It's going to be really cool when it's done but
You know, no, no, I just don't...no
I can't look anybody in the eyes right now...
What? Did somebody say my name?
Did somebody say my name?
No, I've been up all night, I...
I haven't eaten anything, I mean
I just need to get this done before...)
Whallll......ahhhhahahahawlllllll!

LEDs that are red and green
And switches that are squeaky clean
I know it's hard to understand
But pretty soon you'll know what I mean
And if you have a question
My answer will light up on the screen

I've been awake for nearly a week
Don't want to sleep in
'til eyes begin to bleed
Been up all night
Been up all night
Been up all night
I'm up all night
I'm up all night
I'm up all night
I'm up all night
I'm up all night
I'm up all night
