He always sat in the back of the class
There's something wrong with his seeing eye glass
Don't have a future, no he ain't got no past
Slow Learner, you know he don't live fast
He is relaxed

[Verse 1]
Slow Learner know nothing 'bout history
Don't care for politics, he don't know how to read
He don't get stressed out, he need to take it easy
He don't need no friends, he don't need sex, no TV
Slow Learner!

He was in high school 'til he was 22
Until they told him "you need something else to do"
He packed his schoolbooks and he moved to the street
And now he sits there â€“ Slow Learner is happy
Slow learner is happy
[Chorus]

He always sat at the back of the class
There's something wrong with his seeing eye glass
Don't have no future, no he ain't got no past
A Slow Learner, he don't live fast
He is relaxed
Slow Learner!

[Outro]
Slow Learner, Slow Learner
He learns a hundred words an hour

Slow Learner!
