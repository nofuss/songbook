Remember that time
Hole fills and white lines
She's looked like something I'd never seen before

I know she wants it
She's looking hungry
But it won't be happening tonight my dear
Cause everytime I take that shit
You know I just can't get it up
Can't get it up
Can't get it up
Can't get it up now
It ain't because I don't like you
It's just the lifestyle that I've chose
I have a hard time drinking alcohol
Without something going up my nose
Oh I dont know what the deal is
But I feel something wrong with it
Oh let's just wait until the morning
Cause that's when I can do my shit
Can't get it up
Can't get it up
Can't get it up now
Don't give a fuck
Can't get it up now

I didn't mean to ruin your night girl
I truly do apologize
But if we lay here doing nothing
I might as well just take another line
Can't get it up
Can't get it up
Can't get it up now
Oh that really sucks
Can't get it up

During the night time

She's looking like something I'd never seen before
I know she wants it
She's looking hungry
But it won't be happening tonight my dear
'Cause everytime I take that shit you know
I just can't get it up
Can't get it up
Can't get it up now
Oh you really sucks man
You know I just can't get it up

Can't get it up
I can't get it up man
What the fuck is wrong with you
