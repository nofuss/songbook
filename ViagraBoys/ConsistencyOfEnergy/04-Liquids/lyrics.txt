When she walks by I feel like puking
I get depressed just by looking
She’s got a body like a computer
If only she had met me much sooner
I’m too fucked to even see her
But I smell her feets, so I know she’s near
She’s got sharp teeth just like some creature
Wanna bring her home so I can feed her

She walks right by me in slowmotion
She’s got that look, that secret potion
She makes me sick, make my brain hurt
She’s got my weakness under her shirt
Under her shirt
She’s got me sick now to my gizzard
She speaks just like some kind of lizard
She’s dressed in robes like some weird wizard
I fantasize till I get blisters
She ain’t no human, ain’t no ape
I want her liquids all on my face
She don’t wear hats, she’s got green legs
She’s using a carcass as a bed

I want her liquids
I want her liquids
I want her liquids
On my face

I want her liquids
I want her liquids
I want her liquids
On my face

I want her liquids
I want her liquids
I want her liquids
On my face

I want her liquids
I want her liquids
I want her liquids
On my face
