You told me I owe you money
And that I ruined your party
I don't remember that
You're getting nothing back
You told me I peed on the carpet
And then I broke your mother's vase
Well, my memory must have failed me
Cause I ain't ever seen your face

[Chorus 1]
I don't remember that
I don't remember that
You're getting nothing back
I don't remember that
[Verse 2]
I don't remember no sad faces
I don't recall a quiet night
I really felt like I nailed it
Like usual, I behaved just fine
So don't accuse me of being rude
Or making myself look like an ass
I don't believe you speak the truth
Cause I don't remember it like that
I don't remember that

[Chorus 2]
I don't remember that
You're getting nothing back
I don't remember that
I don't remember that
You're getting nothing back

[Verse 3]
It's nice to meet you, what's your name?
I got a feeling that we met before
You told me that we went to dinner
I got too drunk and puked on the floor
Well, that doesn't sound like something I'd do
You better check your fuckin' facts
You're mixing me up with some other dude
I don't remember none of that

[Chorus 3]
I don't remember that
I don't, I don't
You're getting nothing back
I don't remember that
I don't remember that
[Outro]
I don't remember
I don't remember, I don't remember none of it
How could I have done it if I don't remember doing it?
Huh?
You tell me that if you're so fuckin' smart
I don't remember that
