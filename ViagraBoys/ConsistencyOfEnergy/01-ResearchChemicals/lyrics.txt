It's getting hard to breathe
You're feeling like you're gonna die
They told you it was just like weed
That this could happen your first time

Waking up you're drenched in sweat
It's one of many side effects
You'll need a refill every hour
You're getting nosebleeds in the shower

Some toxic waste from a far-away land
Makes you turn green and lose control of your hands
These toxic chemicals got me feeling, super weird man...
Super weird...

Research Chemicals
Got me bleeding from my ears
Research Chemicals
They make 'em better every year

We're in town cooking up some stuff
Psychedelic amphetamine yeah put it in your butt
It ain't like other shit it's twenty times as strong
You'll know it's working when everything feels wrong

Looking forw a brand new way to fry my mind
I want the stuff that makes me retarded all the time
They got this website's got the chemical for me
They recommend one called 8752B

Research Chemicals
Got me bleeding from my ears
Research Chemicals
They make 'em better every year

Research Chemicals
Got me bleeding from my ears
Research Chemicals
They make 'em better every year man...
