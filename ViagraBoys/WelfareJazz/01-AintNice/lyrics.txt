You can have me if you want me
All I need is a little shrimp money
I need to pay for all the shit in my closet
I need a place to put all my electronics

[Refrain]
Ain't nice
I ain't nice

[Verse 2]
You ain't that nice, but you got a nice face
Hope I can fit all my shit at your place
Got a collection of vintage calculators
If you don't like it, well babe, I'll see you later
[Refrain]
Ain't nice
I ain't nice
Ain't nice

[Verse 3]
Oh, trust me honey, you don't want me
I start a-screamin' if you look at me funny

[Refrain]
Ain't nice
I ain't nice

[Verse 4]
I'll borrow your stuff and never put it back
I'm kinda hungry, can you give me a snack?

[Refrain]
I ain't nice
I ain't nice
I ain't nice

[Outro]
It ain't nice (Whoo!)
Ain't nothing nice
It ain't nicе
No, it ain't nice
Ain't nothing nice
Ain't nothing nice
Ain't nothing nicе
It ain't nice
It ain't nice
Ain't nothing nice
I ain't nice
Ain't nothing nice
I ain't nice
Ain't nothing nice
Ain't nothing nice
It ain't nice
