[Verse 1]
I stole a shrimp from the local zoo
I've got a tank at home, what about you?
I'm selling drugs to the kids at the school
I'm up all night, goonin' to a picture of you
If you knew, the things I do
To get ingredients, to get ingredients for my perpetual stew

Uh, uh, uh
Uh, ah

I'm sorry, sir
