[Intro]
Huh, uh! Oh
Okay, alright
Okay, alright
Okay, okay
Alright (okay)

[Verse 1]
Overweight freaks ride around on wheelchairs motorized by electric motors made by goblins in a factory overseas
They're there to buy drywall and other products that they can eat back at home on the sofa
They watch TV
They watch TV about a man named Chandler Bing who died in a freak hot tubbing accident
And spent his time drinking hot dog flavored water
On a popular TV show called Tub Girls

[Chorus]
I don't wanna pay for anything
Clothes and food and drugs for free
If it was 1970
I'd have a job at a factory
I am a man that's made of meat
And you're on the internet looking at feet
I hate almost everything that I see
And I just wanna disappear

[Post-Chorus]
Okay, alright
Okay, alright
Okay, alright
M'kay

[Verse 2]
I stand outside of the McDonald's
I'm flexing my muscles 'til I explode
I hope they see me in the drive-thru lane
I-I hope they see me in the drive-thru lane
I stand outside of the L.L. Bean
I'm trying to get some free women sweaters, you know what I mean?
I hope they see me in the drive-thru lane
I hope, I hope they, I hope they, I hope they

[Chorus]
I don't wanna pay for anything
Clothes and food and drugs for free
If it was 1970
I'd have a job at a factory
I am a man that's made of meat
And you're on the internet looking at feet
I hate almost everything that I see
And I just wanna disappear

[Bridge]
I'm subscribed to your mom's OnlyFans
I spent five bucks a month to get pictures of her flappy giblets
And I spent another ten dollars a month to chat with her on the AI chat program
It feels great
[Chorus]
I don't wanna pay for anything
Clothes and food and drugs for free
If it was 1970
I'd have a job at a factory
I am a man that's made of meat
And you're on the internet looking at feet
I hate almost everything that I see
And I just wanna disappear
