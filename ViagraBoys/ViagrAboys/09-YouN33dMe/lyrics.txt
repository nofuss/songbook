I can make your girl stop what she's doin' and turn around and watch me do my little dance
I can drink about fifteen beers or maybe twenty-five, it depends on the can
I can drop a lot of interesting facts about Europe in the 1950s
Uh, but it doesn't mean anything if you ain't here with me
Because I need you and you need me

[Chorus]
You need me
You need me
You need me
You need me

[Verse 2]
I can make your man stop what he's doin' and walk straight up to me and fucking knock me out
I can bring the type of vibe to the party that nobody likes and I make everybody sad
I can drop some historical facts about World War II and other things
But it doesn't mеan anything if you ain't here with me
'Causе I need you and you need me

[Chorus]
You need me
You need me
You need me
You need me

Did ya know that the last Japanese soldiers surrendered in 1998?
And they were actually, it was qui— it was commonplace to use bears in the Polish army
And another, another interesting fact is that most deaths happened in pilot school, I believe

[Verse 3]
I can make your girl stop what she's doin' and turn around and watch me do my little dance
I can drink about fifteen beers or twenty-five, it depends on the can
I can drop some historical facts about wars in Europe that you know nothing about
But it doesn't mean anything if you ain't here with me 'cause I need you and you need me (You need me)

[Chorus]
You need me
You need me
You need me
You need me
You need me
You need me
You need me
You need me

[Outro]
You need me
