I showed up to the party in my favourite coat
On the back was an image of a shrimp on a boat
When you saw what I was wearing you got real upset
And said, “that's the jacket that I got from my grandma”
And well I promise I ain't seen you before
And maybe your grandma had bought a couple more
And maybe I helped her at the grocery store
And she gave it to me as a gift
So quit bitchin', motherfucker
[Verse 2]
I went out to the porch to light a cigarette
I have six to seven lighters in my left pocket
I took out the one that said Shrimp City Beach 1993
And you told me that's where you had your birthday party
And that the lighters were given as gifts
But I was there too, just dipping my toes down on the beach, man
And I had that lighter specifically made for me, motherfucker

[Refrain]
I ain't no thief
(He ain't no thief)
I ain't no thief
(He ain't no thief)
I said, I ain't no thief
(He ain't no thief)
But he got the same stuff
Huh, I said, I ain't no thief (He's got the same stuff)
(He ain't no thief)
I ain't no thief
(He ain't no thief)
I said, I ain't no thief
(He ain't no thief
But he got the same stuff)
We just got the same stuff
I said, we got
We, we got the same stuff, man
I ain't no thief
We just happen to have the same stuff, motherfucker, ooh

I recall buyin' this
I recall buyin' this exact lighter when I was 15 years old
My grandpappy gave it to me as a present
Because I had just finished Boy Scout trainin'
And he was so proud of me, that he decided
To create this lighter in the exact same image of yours

[Refrain]
I said, I ain't no thief
I ain't no thief
I said, I ain't no thief
I ain't no thief
We just, oh
Oh, I said, I ain't no thief
I ain't no thief
I said, I ain't no thief
I ain't no thief
We just got the same stuff

[Outro]
Enjoy the music on your radio
I found this jacket right outside your store
