When we met, you thought that I could probably change
I warned you then, that baby, I don't seem insane
But I fucking am, and I'm rocking a little gold chain
That ain't real gold, I told you that it's fucking fake

[Pre-Chorus]
I spend my money elsewhere on different things
That come in little plastic bags, and they disappear
The same night, the same night

[Chorus]
I ain't your average normal dude
It sure ain't glamorous, but I keep things loose
I ain't your average punk rock loser
Yeah, I'm a savage, I'm really cool
I tried to warn you I'm loose!

[Verse 2]
I tried to warn you that I'm bad and I'm loose
I'm looser than a piece of a low-hanging fruit
And I don't go to parties where folks get dressed up
I go to the function just to fuck shit up
I warned you, baby, that ain't juice in my cup
It's promethazine and a little 7UP

I tried to warn you that I'm bad and I'm loose
I'm looser than a piece of a low-hanging fruit

[Chorus]
I ain't your average normal dude
It sure ain't glamorous, but I keep things loose
I ain't your average punk rock loser
Yeah, I'm a savage, I'm really cool
I'm loose!
I said I'm loose, baby! Woo!

[Verse 3]
I'm drenched in sweat when I wake up, need to hang up my sheets
Pour up a beer and walk out with no shoes on my feet
And I don't need nobody tell me how to dress
I look in the mirror saying, 'Man, you're the best!'
And I'm sorry, honey, but I gotta confess
Don't give a fuck about you, I could really care less

[Chorus]
I ain't your average normal dude
It sure ain't glamorous, but I keep things loose
I ain't your average punk rock loser
Yeah, I'm a savage, I'm really cool
I'm really cool, but most of all, I'm loose!
