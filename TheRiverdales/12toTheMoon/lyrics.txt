12 to the Moon, we gotta leave soon
Do you wonder if we're ever coming back?
12 into space, we got a pretty case
There's a Moon base that we're gonna track

Bye bye Earth, baby Earth, baby bye bye now
Bye bye Earth, yeah it hurts, baby I am a
I'm a little scared

Do you ever think of me, when I'm floating up there in a dream?
12 from the Moon, we gotta leave soon
And you know we're never ever coming back
12 to the Earth, but safety comes first
Damn our mission failed, and we're under attack

Bye bye Moon, baby Moon, baby bye bye now
Bye bye Moon, yeah it's you, baby I am a
I'm a little scared
A little scared
I'm a little scared
A little scared
