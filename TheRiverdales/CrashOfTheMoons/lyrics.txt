Oh baby, oh baby, oh baby
I wish I could go back, I wish I could go back
Oh baby, oh baby, oh baby
I could be better than that, so much better than that

What you don't know isn't gonna hurt you
We'll be long gone soon, from the crash of the moons
And I just wanna tell you that I love you
We'll be long gone soon, from the crash of the moons

Oh baby, oh baby, oh baby
This will be our last night, I wanna make it just right
Oh baby, oh baby, oh baby
That kaleidoscope sky, shining on you and I

What you don't know isn't gonna hurt you
We'll be long gone soon, from the crash of the moons
And I just wanna tell you that I love you
We'll be long gone soon, from the crash of the moons
