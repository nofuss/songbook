I am Governor Jerry Brown
My aura smiles and never frowns
Soon, I will be president
Carter power will soon go away
I will be Führer one day
I will command all of you
Your kids will meditate in school
Your kids will meditate in school

[Chorus]
California über alles
California über alles
Über alles, California
Über alles, California

[Verse 2]
Zen fascists will control you
One-hundred percent natural
You will jog for the master race
And always wear the happy face
Close your eyes, can't happen here
Big Bro on white horse is near
The hippies won't come back, you say
Mellow out, or you will pay
Mellow out, or you will pay
See upcoming rock shows
Get tickets for your favorite artists

[Chorus]
California über alles
California über alles
Über alles, California
Über alles, California

[Bridge]
Now it is 1984
Knock-knock at your front door
It's the suede denim secret police
They have come for your uncool niece
Come quietly to the camp
You'd look nice as a drawstring lamp
Don't you worry, it's only a shower
For your clothes, here's a pretty flower
Die! On organic poison gas
Serpent's egg's already hatched
You will croak, you little clown
When you mess with President Brown
When you mess with President Brown

[Chorus]
California über alles
California über alles
Über alles, California
Über alles, California
