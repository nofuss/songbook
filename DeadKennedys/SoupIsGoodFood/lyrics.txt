We're sorry, but you're no longer needed
Or wanted, or even cared about here
Machines can do a better job than you
And this is what you get for asking questions
The unions agree, "Sacrifices must be made"
Computers never go on strike
To save the working man
You've got to put him out to pasture
Looks like we'll have to let you go
Doesn't it feel fulfilling to know
That you, the human being, are now obsolete
And there's nothing in hell we'll let you do about it?
[Chorus]
Soup is good food (We don't need you anymore)
You made a good meal (We don't need you anymore)
How does it feel to be shit out our ass
And thrown in the cold like a piece of trash?

[Verse 2]
We're sorry, you'll just have to leave
Unemployment runs out after just six weeks
How does it feel to be a budget cut?
You're snipped, you no longer exist
Your number's been purged from our central computer
So we can rig the facts and sweep you under the rug
See our chart, unemployment's going down
If that ruins your life, that's your problem

[Chorus]
Soup is good food (We don't need you anymore)
You made a good meal (We don't need you anymore)
Now how does it feel to be shit out our ass
And thrown in the cold?

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Verse 3]
We're sorry, we hate to interrupt
But it's against the law to jump off this bridge
You'll just have to kill yourself somewhere else
A tourist might see you and we wouldn't want that
I'm just doing my job, you know
So say uncle and we'll take you to the mental health zoo
Force-feed you mind-melting chemicals
'Til even the outside world looks great
In hi-tech science research labs
It costs too much to bury all the dead
The mutilated, disease-injected
Surplus rats who can't be used anymore
So they're dumped with no minister present
In a spiraling corkscrew disposal unit
Ground into sludge and flushed away

[Refrain]
We don't need you anymore
We don't need you anymore

[Chorus]
Soup is good food (We don't need you anymore)
You made a good meal (We don't need you anymore)
Now how does it feel to be shit out our ass
And thrown in the cold like a piece of trash?

[Verse 4]
We know how much you'd like to die
We joke about it on our coffee breaks
But we're paid to force you to have a nice day
In the wonderful world we made just for you

[Outro]
"Poor rats," we human rodents chuckle
"At least we get a dignified cremation"
Yet, at 6:00 tomorrow morning
It's time to get up and go to work
