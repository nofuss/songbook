You're from out of town
I can tell that by your shoes
Flew in for the convention
Getting tipsy in a bar

[Verse 2]
You're leavin' pretty late
Gotta get up in the morning
Thinking she's just too expensive
And you know you're... probably... right!

[Verse 3]
There's no one on the streets
And you can't find your hotel
You walk a little faster
Someone's following you

[Verse 4]
The wallet-size bulge
In your double-knit butt
Has money for me
And maybe credit cards

[Bridge]
You dart around the next corner
You can't look around
Quick now, fish for the keys for the door
You don't even know where you are

[Verse 5]
You walk a little faster
I walk a little faster
Sensing that I sense you
And now there's no escape

[Outro]
I can almost taste your dandruff
As I reach out for your face
And I strike!
