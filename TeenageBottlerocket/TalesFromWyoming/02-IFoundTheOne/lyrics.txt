I, I found the one
Yeah she's as perfect as she seems
The star of all of my wet dreams
I found the girl, I found the one
I, I found the one
Yeah she doesn't fuck around
She turns my world all upside down
I found the girl I found the one
And there is nothing that can turn me off of you
You get me all fucked up like I've been sniffing glue
And I'm so horny that I don't know what to do
And now my balls are turning blue
I, I found the one
Yeah she always treats me right
I wanna do her every night
I found the girl, I found the one
