I'm falling apart with a broken heart for the first time
I'm starting to doubt what this feeling's about
For the first time
I stare at the wall, I'm beginning to fall
For the first time
Asleep on the floor
Don't go out anymore
For the first time
I'm spinning out of control
With nowhere left to go
For the first time I can't seem to figure it out
For the first time I can't hear you
For the first time I'm not near you
And I'm not going to live that life anymore
For the First time
For the first time
I'm falling apart with a broken heart for the first time
I'm starting to doubt what this feeling's about
For the first time
I stare at the wall, I'm beginning to fall
For the first time
Asleep on the floor
Don't go out anymore
For the first time
I'm spinning out of control
With nowhere left to go
For the first time I can't seem to figure it out
For the first time I can't hear you
For the first time I'm not near you
A loneliness I've never felt before
For the first time I can't see you
For the first time I can't be you
And I'm not going to live that life anymore
For the first time
For the first time
