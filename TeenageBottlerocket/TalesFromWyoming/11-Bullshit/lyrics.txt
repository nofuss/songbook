Can't ignore it any more so I'm calling you out on all your bullshit
We've had it up to here, it's crystal clear that you're full of it
You get around, You run your mouth
Open your trap and there's a river of crap flooding the ground
I'm calling you out because you're bumming us out with all your bullshit
Stuff your sorrys in a sack, you know you're full of it
I used to sit back and keep my mouth shut, now all that is through
I can't put up with anymore
Bullshit, Bullshit, Bullshit, Bullshit
You get around, You run your mouth
Open your trap and there's a river of crap flooding the ground
Bullshit! Bullshit!
We're calling you out because you're bumming us out with all your bullshit
