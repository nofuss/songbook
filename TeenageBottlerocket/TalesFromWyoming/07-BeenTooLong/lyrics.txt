I, I've been a mess here without you
You wonder why. I never called, we came unglued
You said goodbye, I promised everything's ok
The truth is I, I feel alone I feel the same
I'm staying out too late and I really don't care
My friends all think I'm unaware
Of the way I'm treating everyone
I've been staring at my phone since you've been gone
It's been too long since we laughed ourselves to sleep
It's been too long, I miss giving you the creeps
It's been too long
You won't have a problem finding someone else
It's true, everything that I went through was nothing new
Now I toss and turn all night thinking of you
And how you're twisted and insane and I like it
Out too late and I really don't care
My friends all think I'm unaware
Of the way I' m treating everyone
I've been staring at my phone since you've been gone
It's been too long since we laughed ourselves to sleep
It's been too long, I miss giving you the creeps
It's been too long, I want to run away with you
It's been too long, for at least a day or two
It's been too long
Counted on a second chance, But nothing lasts forever
I get it now, it's one strike and we're done
Tried to face another day
I can't get it together
Don't want to spend another night alone
I, I've been a mess here without you
You wonder why. I never called, we came unglued
It's been too long since we laughed ourselves to sleep
It's been too long, I miss giving you the creeps
It's been too long, I want to run away with you
It's been too long, for at least a day or two
It's been too long
