I knocked down a tree with my bare hands
And I've been to all four corners of this land
I killed a giant spider with an iron sword
And I ran ten miles being chased by a zombie hoard
They call me Steve, I'll do anything you want me to
They call me Steve, I'll dig a hole to hell and back for you
I built a giant mansion in a mountain side
And it's fully furnished with a pool and water slide
But late at night the creepers walk me home
But I don't mind I'm getting used to spending nights alone
They call me Steve, I'll do anything you want me to
They call me Steve, I'll dig a hole to hell and back for you
I don't know what to do cause me and Steve are really missing you
They call me Steve, I'll do anything you want me to
They call me Steve, I'll dig a hole to hell and back for you
They call me Steve, I'll do anything you want me to
They call me Steve, I'll dig a hole to hell and back for you
