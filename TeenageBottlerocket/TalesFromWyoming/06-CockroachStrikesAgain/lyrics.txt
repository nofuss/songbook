This city's cold and struck with fear
They feel the evil drawing near
We better stay inside and lock our windows tight
He’s lurking in the night
Everything won't be alright, not anymore

The cops they never had a clue
'bout what he'd done and what he'll do
Get on your radio, call in a lot more men
He's on the loose again
And we gotta put an end to his charade

Cockroach strikes again
This time the bad guy’s gonna win
They better catch him soon
Before the next full moon
That's when cockroach strikes again

Newspapers spin hot off the press
They say the crime scene was a mess
The latest victims were both sleeping in their bed
When he shot them in the head
Now the walls are spattered red with brain and bone

Cockroach strikes again
This time the bad guy’s gonna win
They better catch him soon
Before the next full moon
That's when cockroach strikes again
