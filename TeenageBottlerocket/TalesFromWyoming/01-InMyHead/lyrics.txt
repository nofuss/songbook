In my head, you're in my head you're in my
In my head, stuck in my head you're in my
In my head, you're in my head you're in my
In my head, stuck in my head you're in my head
The way you're pounding on my brain should be a crime
Tried to carve you out by sticking needles in my eyes
You got a gun to my head you're sticking up my brain
Because you're stuck in my mind
I'd do anything to get you out
In my head, you're in my head you're in my
In my head, stuck in my head you're in my
In my head, you're in my head you're in my
In my head, stuck in my head you're in my head
And I'm dead because I can't get you out of my head
Fixed to my brain like all your stains
That won't scrub out of my bed
In my head, you're in my head you're in my
In my head, stuck in my head you're in my
In my head, you're in my head you're in my
In my head, stuck in my head you're in my head
