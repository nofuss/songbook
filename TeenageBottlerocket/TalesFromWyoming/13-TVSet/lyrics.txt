My TV set
Makes me so upset
There's a lot of people crying
There's a lot of people dying
On my TV set
On My TV Set
In magazines
These girls don't look that cool to me
On the internet
That's like the worst place yet
On my TV set
On my TV set
It's in our heads, it's in our drinks
It's on the radio
They're going to try to tell you what to think
So put down your remote controls
I'm going to stand up to the things they do though I'll
Never really matter at all
There's nothing shocking nowadays after everything I saw
On my TV set
On My TV set
