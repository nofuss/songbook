I didn't wake up, I was up all night
It was totally tight and I feel alright yeah
The sun is out and I'm hanging out
I'm checking out a band that I'm all about
I can't remember anything
I can't tell if this is true or dream
My thoughts keep swimming back to you
Because we shared a different point of view
That guy was such a dickhead
When we were sticking up for Jason Newsted
That's when you said you loved …And Justice For All

I didn't make up with the creeps that night
They were looking for a fight I was totally right on
The frayed end of sanity, the shortest straw has been pulled for me
I'll probably fade to black someday, Unless you hit the lights
And escape with me
I jumped into the fire and found
A blackened out heart because you're not around
That guy was such a dickhead
When we were sticking up for Jason Newsted
That's when you said you loved …And Justice For All

I saw you dancing on the floor
When they kicked me out the door
Wont you tell me that I'm the one
Cuz I'm a mess when I'm alone
We used to listen to Kill ‘em All
A Pushead poster on your wall
Way before Unforgiven two
Nothing else matters when I'm with you
