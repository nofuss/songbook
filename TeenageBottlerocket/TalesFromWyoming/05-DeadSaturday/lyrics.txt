Death is in the air, something's not alright
I took a peek outside, it was an evil sight
A rotting corpse was eating my neighbor's head
Just like a scene from the living dead
Freaks outside tried to break down my front door
They've had a taste of blood and now they're wanting more
There's a gun in the basement
There's a body on the pavement
Dead Saturday, Dead Saturday
Tried to bail but I lost the keys to my car
I've got a feeling that we're not going to get that far
They're coming in through the window
This is not an innuendo
Dead Saturday, Dead Saturday
Dead Saturday, Dead Saturday
Manifestation, bad vibration,
Life cancellation, amputation
They're going to feed on us tonight
Mass annihilation, Disintegration,
Hazardous Mutations, Ill Communication
They're going to feed on us tonight
Better run for your fucking life
Dead Saturday, Dead Saturday
Dead Saturday, Dead Saturday
