I called in sick, I showed up late
Forgot to clock out
Then took a smoke break
Got fired the other day but I can't quit you
No money, no job. I suck at life, kicked out of my mom's at 35
I gave up the fight but I can't quit you
Blame my addictive personality
Stuck to you like bubblegum with nicotine
No more bumming cigarettes
Gave up smoking crystal meth
Cut back on greasy food
But I can't quit you
Skateboard focused by some car
Burned down the ramp in my backyard
Doesn't matter because I pretty much sucked
But I can't quit you
Tried to work out to lose some weight
No more drive thru's or chocolate shakes
I quit eating out and now you're bummed
Blame my addictive personality
Stuck to you like bubblegum with nicotine
No more bumming cigarettes
Gave up smoking crystal meth
Cut back on greasy food
But I can't quit you
Never had a problem with addiction till I first laid eyes on you
Now I'm going through withdrawals ever since you said we were through
I can't quit you
