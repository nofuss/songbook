I'm getting hungry and I need a fix
A taste that hits you like a ton of bricks
Got La Collina and I feel alright
There's so much pleasure here in every bite
But I had too much too much too much La Collina
I've had it fifteen times since the last time that I seen ya
Yeah I had too much too much too much La Collina
And if I eat much more I'm probably gonna die
I got my pizza and I'm digging in
P-P-P-Pepperoni grease is dripping down my chin.
Yeah I'm so full but now I just can't stop
Be eating La Collina til I drop
I think I'm gonna fucking pop cause
I had too much too much too much La Collina
I've had it fifteen times since the last time that I seen ya
Yeah I had too much too much too much La Collina
And if I eat much more I'm probably gonna die
I think I'm gonna die
