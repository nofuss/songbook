You tried to tell me it was make believe
I pretended not to hear you
You said beware cuz it wasn't there
But it never really seemed to get through
What did you mean cuz it seems like a scary dream
You left me bleeding on your doorstep
I'm deaf not blind I see I'm out of time
I couldn't hear a word that you said

You don't got with the flow
You just go where you go
And you know what you know
And you do cuz you feel like doing so
You laughed when I cryied
I never wanted you to say goodbye
Now I don't care what I'm gonna do
I lay in bed all day and I'm thinking of you

I guess you fell for the fairy tale
My hair grew a little longer
Days passed by and so did night
I wonder why I even bothered
And now you're down and on the ground
Cuz you never found a single thing
You thought to look for
I tried to make myself forget
I'll never feel the way I did before

I don't go with the flow
I just go where I go
And I know what I know
And I do cuz I feel like doing so
I laughed when you cried
You never wanted me to say goodbye
Now you don't care where you're going to be
You lay in bed all night and you're thinking of me yeah
