There's a place in the city you don't want to go
An evil house that has ascended from the depths below
There are Crass and other punker posters hanging on the doors
And two dirty dogs fighting and shitting all over the floors

Of the punk house
Don't say that you have not been warned
It's a punk house
Don't go into the punk house of horror

There's a guy named Rat who smells like piss and methamphetamine
He says he hates religion but he's wanting god to save the queen
There's a gnarly fucking grime on everything that you will see inside
And a mutant form of stink that simply cannot be identified

In the punk house
This place is a fucking dive
It's a punk house
Don't go into the punk house of horror
It's a punk house
You'll be lucky to get out alive
Of the punk house
Don't go into the punk house of horror
It's a punk house of horror
Punk house of horror
It's a punk house ofâ€¦
