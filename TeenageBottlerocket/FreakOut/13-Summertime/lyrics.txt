Baby I'm getting sick of all the cold and snow
I wish there was a warmer place that we could go
Maybe in California hanging on the beach
Or over in some desert in the Middle East

Even though that would be great
I think we're still gonna have to wait
For summertime, when it's hot as Mexico
We'll drive around, roll the windows down
Turn up the stereo, yeah it's summertime

Winter ain't the weather I'm wantin'
I wanna be where there's warm and sun
It's summertime
