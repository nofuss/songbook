Welcome to the land where the retards dwell
Tornado of the damned, it's a living hell
We'll act like we're 10 and run around this place
In redneck circles like a NASCAR race
It's much fun getting kicked in the face
We're too fucking dumb to quit
In the pit

The duck went down now the duck is dead
They moshed his brains right out of his head
Where douchebags go to to blow off some steam
Cuz coach wouldn't put 'em on the football team
And asshole jocks' fucking wettest dream
Dumber than a piece of shit
In the pit
