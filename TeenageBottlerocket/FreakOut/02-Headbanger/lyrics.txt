Last night I went to a party
It was a heavy metal party
Everybody had poofy hairdos
Sporting big white Adidas sneakers
But everybody was having a good time
Everybody was gettin' wasted
And this this guy came in the room
Looking like the ghost of Cliff Burton

He was a headbanger
He whipped his head around so fast
He gave himself a concussion
Dude you better slow down
Before you break your neck
You know that shit can't be good for your brain

Holy shit man I can't take it
Just the sight of it was making me dizzy
Someone asked if I was in the KISS Army
And I sad, "What the fuck are you talking about?"
But everybody was having a good time
They were riding the Banzai pipeline
And then this guy took off his denim jacket
And his shirt said 'Bark at the Moon'

He was a headbanger
He whipped his head around so fast
He gave himself a concussion
Dude you better slow down
You're gonna give me a fucking headache.
You know that shit can't be good for your brain
Headbanger
