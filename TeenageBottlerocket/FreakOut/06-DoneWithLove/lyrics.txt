I got shit to do
No time for hanging out and no time for you
I've got no time to waste
I'd rather be some other place

No one's getting in cuz I've got a heart of stone
And it doesn't bother me to be alone
My line is disconnected so hang up the phone
I'm done with love

Yeah I don't need all the bullshit
I need that like a hole in the head
I've cut off all my emotion
Everything inside of me is dead, just like I said
I'm done with love
