You're totally radical and I'm totally fanatical
I'm not being hypothetical when I tell you
What I want to tell you
It might be irrational
But the place I stayed inside your head
Is now occupied by some other guy
Cuz I couldn't afford the rent

Never thought I'd be first in line
To get a second chance
So won't you give me half a second
While I figure out where we both stand
Remember when you told me
That you'd stay with me forever
I will never forget those couple of days
