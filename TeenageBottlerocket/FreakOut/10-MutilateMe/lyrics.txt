Hey, we’ve been at it a long time now
And you oughta know by now
The crazy thoughts running loose in my brain

Hey, I don’t get off that easily
So don’t take it easy on me
Try to wipe that stupid smile off my face

When your hands are wrapped around
The front of my throat
You know I never want you to let go

(I want you to) dominate me
(I want you to) violate me
(I want you to) Then for what it’s worth
(I want you to) Pretend you hate me
(I want you to) dominate me
(I want you to) mutilate me
(I want you to) Then for what it’s worth
(I want you to) Pretend you hate me

Hey, you say there’s something wrong with me
I’m just speaking honestly
I don’t want to be a stranger to pain

Hey, I think that something’s wrong with you
Maybe it’s your attitude
Or just people putting thoughts in your head

When your hands are wrapped around
The front of my neck
You know I never want you to let go

(I want you to) dominate me
(I want you to) violate me
(I want you to) Then for what it’s worth
(I want you to) Pretend you hate me
(I want you to) dominate me
(I want you to) mutilate me
(I want you to) Then for what it’s worth
(I want you to) Pretend you hate me
