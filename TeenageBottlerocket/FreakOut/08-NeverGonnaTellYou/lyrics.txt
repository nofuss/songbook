I'm never gonna tell you that I'll never let you go
I'm never gonna tell you but I'm hoping that you know
I'm never gonna tell you that I want to go make out
I'm never gonna tell you that you're all I think about

I'm never gonna tell you, it's true
My lips are super glued
You're all I ever talk about when I'm away from you
I'm never gonna tell you

I'm never gonna tell you when we watched the living dead
You turned into a zombie and you ate my brain instead
if I blow my cover I see it coming to an end
I'm never gonna tell you that you're more than just a friend

I'm never gonna tell you, it's true
My face is turning blue
I think that I might fall apart when I'm alone with you
When I'm alone with you
