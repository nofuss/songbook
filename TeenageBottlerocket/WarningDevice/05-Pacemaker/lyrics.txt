Spent some time getting over you
And all the shit that you put me through
I'd cut those days in half somehow
If I knew then what I know now
Weeks turned into months alone
I'm better off now that you're gone

When I finally got my head in shape
It took forever to do so oh oh
Realized that my biggest mistake
Was taking to long to let go

It took some time getting rid of you
Breaking up was way past due
One more minute with you around
Would have made my payment down
You whine, you moan, you always bitch
The best thing I did for myself was ditch

When I finally got my head in shape
It took forever to do so oh oh
Realized that my biggest mistake
Was taking to long to let go

Days went by
Thank god I didn't hold my breath
I felt it in my chest
When you were stepping on me
Now you're begging me to take you back
I need that like a heart attack
Like a hole in my brain

Took my time getting used to me
Single life's far from boring
Its never to late to come home
Not checking in, no telephone
So sick of all your attitude
Have no regrets for leaving you

When I finally got my head in shape
It took forever to do so oh oh
Realized that my biggest mistake
Was taking to long to let go

Days went by
Thank god I didn't hold my breath
I felt it in my chest
When you were stepping on me
Now you're begging me to take you back
I need that like a heart attack
Like a hole in my brain
