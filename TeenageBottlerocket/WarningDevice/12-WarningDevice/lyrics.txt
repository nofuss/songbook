I wish that sixteen weeks ago
I could've met your friend
And that she'd tell me all the things
You'd put me through and then
She'd tell me that you're full of shit
And you'd treat me like it too
She'd have a chance to talk me out of
Mistakes I've make with you

She'd give me back time I spent
Playing make believe with you
You say you wanted honesty
But pretending isn't true
Careful what you wish for
I wish that someone would have talked
Me out of talking to you and
We'd never get our start

And when I'd see you I'd simply run away
I wouldn't have to break your heart
Or make you want to stay
And when I'd see you
I'd have a second chance
I wouldn't have to waste another day
Feeling like I did today
Like I did today
