I just want to be alone
Yeah, I don't want a social life
Disconnect my telephone
Yeah, I don't want a social life

There's no place I'd rather be
Than sitting here watching TV
Cause hanging out just ain't for me no more

You say there's something wrong with me
Yeah, I don't have a social life
Cause home is where I want to be
Yeah, I don't have a social life

But I'm not hanging out with you
Cause I've got better things to do
I'm gonna watch first blood part 2 tonight

I'm not going out tonight
Yeah, I don't have a social life
Don't want anyone in sight
Yeah, I don't have a social life

Thought that I should let you know
There's no place I wanna go
When I turn on the stereo tonight

I don't a social life anymore
(whoa oh oh)
I don't a social life anymore
(whoa oh oh)
I don't a social life anymore
(whoa oh oh)
I don't a social life anymore
