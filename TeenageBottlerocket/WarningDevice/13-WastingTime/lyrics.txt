I've got a picture of your face stuck in my head like super-glue,
And fourteen hours of TV hasn't deluded any thoughts of you.
But now I'm acting like the living dead, thinking of all the stupid things I said
And how you laughed anyway, even though I wasn't making sense.

And now the murdering of minutes is my only crime,
'Cause I've been sitting here for days, thinking of words that rhyme
To say that thinking of you is the way I like to waste my time.

It's three a.m. and once again, I'm wide awake, lying here in my bed,
And it's been over two weeks and you're still hanging out inside my head.
But now I'm acting like the living dead, thinking of all the stupid things I said
And how you laughed anyway, even though I wasn't making sense.

And now the murdering of minutes is my only crime,
'Cause I've been sitting here for days, thinking of words that rhyme
To say that thinking of you is the way I like to waste my time.
Yeah, I said thinking of you is the way I like to waste my time.

Yeah.
Thinking of you is the way I like to waste my time.
Thinking of you is the way I like to waste my time.
Thinking of you is the way I like to waste my time.
Whoa.
