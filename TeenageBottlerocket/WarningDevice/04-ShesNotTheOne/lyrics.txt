She's not the one oh oh oh [x4]

She's not the one [x7]

She's not the one oh oh oh [x7]

She's not the one [x7]

Fed up with make believe affection
I won't pretend to be her love

She's not the one oh oh oh oh oh
(She's not the one)
She's not the one oh oh oh oh oh
(She's not the one)
She's not the one oh oh oh oh oh
(She's not the one)
She's not the one oh oh oh oh oh
(She's not the one)

She's not the one
