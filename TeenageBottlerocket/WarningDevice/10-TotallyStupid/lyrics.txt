Sometimes I get so bored I don't know what to do
Don't feel like smoking dope don't feel like sniffing glue
I need a change of pace yea I need something new
Don't want to use my head don't want to get a clue

Cause when I'm hanging out with you
I'm acting totally stupid
You're acting totally stupid
We're acting totally stupid
Cause we've got nothing better to do

Sometimes I sit around all night and watch TV
Sometimes I think my brain's taking control of me
I feel so full of pure retarded energy
They need to lock us up and throw away the key

Cause when you're hanging out with me
I'm acting totally stupid
You're acting totally stupid
We're acting totally stupid
Cause we've got nothing better to do

I'm acting totally stupid
You're acting totally stupid
We're acting totally stupid
Cause we've got nothing better to do

We're acting totally stupid cause we've got nothing to do
We're acting totally stupid cause we've got nothing to do
We're acting totally stupid cause we've got nothing to do
We're acting totally stupid cause we've got nothing to do
