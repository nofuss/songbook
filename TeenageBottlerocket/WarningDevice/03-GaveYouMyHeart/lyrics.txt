When we first met
I didn't know what to do
So I gave you my heart
Now it belongs to you

I gave you my heart
I gave you my heart
I gave you my heart
So baby please don't tear it apart

And when we hang out
You know we have lots of fun
So I gave you my heart
Cause I knew you were the one

I gave you my heart
I gave you my heart
I gave you my heart
So baby please don't tear it apart

Yeah it was something that I swore I'd never do (Swore I'd never do)
But my whole world turned upside down when I laid eyes on you
When I laid eyes on you

When I'm with you
Don't wanna go away
So I gave you my heart
And now I'm here to stay

I gave you my heart
I gave you my heart
I gave you my heart
So baby please don't tear it apart

I gave you my heart
I gave you my heart
I gave you my heart
So baby please don't tear it apart

I gave you my heart whoa oh yeah
(Oh baby please don't tear it apart)
I gave you my heart whoa oh yeah
(Oh baby please don't tear it apart)
I gave you my heart whoa oh yeah
(Oh baby please don't tear it apart)

Oh baby please don't tear it apart
