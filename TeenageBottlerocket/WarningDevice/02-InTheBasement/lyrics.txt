I'm not going down the stairs no more
There's something here living under the floor
I haven't seen it but I know its there
Now I'm so scared I wet my underwear

That's why I don't want to go
Down, Down, Down in the basement
That's why I don't want to go
Down, Down, Down in the basement tonight

Late at night when I'm in my bed
I pull the covers up over my head
I hear it creepy up from down below
Its come to take me where I don't wanna go

That's why I don't want to go (Don't wanna go oh)
Down, Down, Down in the basement
That's why I don't want to go (Don't wanna go oh)
Down, Down, Down in the basement
That's why I don't want to go (Don't wanna go oh)
Down, Down, Down in the basement
That's why I don't want to go (Don't wanna go oh)
Down, Down, Down in the basement tonight

I don't wanna go down in the basement tonight [x4]
