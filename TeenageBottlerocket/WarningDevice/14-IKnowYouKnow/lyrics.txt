I know you know are you for sure
I think you're going nowhere
So what who cares there's no one
There is gonna be a nightmare

I can't pretend to be your friend 
In fact I wish you'd shut up
I'm givin' you a couple weeks
Before you're moving back up


Do you recall the time
You saw me and pretended not to
That's fine with me 
I'd rather be so non-existent to you

You toss and turn and shake and squirm 
The first night you're not around here
By the second week you'll be so freaked 
Your thoughts will be fucked up here


I know you know
I think you're goin' nowhere
I know you know
It's gonna be a nightmare


Do you recall the time
You saw me and pretended not to
That's fine with me 
I'd rather be so non-existent to you

You toss and turn and shake and and squirm 
The first night you're not around here
By the second week you'll be so freaked 
Your thoughts will be fucked up here


I know you know
I think you're goin' nowhere
I know you know
It's gonna be a nightmare

I know you know
I think you're goin' nowhere
I know you know
It's gonna be a nightmare
