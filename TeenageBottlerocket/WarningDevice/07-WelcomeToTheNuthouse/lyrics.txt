I'm in the nuthouse
I'm in the nuthouse
I'm in the nuthouse
And they're not gonna let me out of here

I'm in the nuthouse
I'm in the nuthouse baby
I'm in the nuthouse
And they're not gonna let me out of here

I couldn't take the shit anymore
Freaked out and then I hit the floor
Wiggled around yea I was having fun
I got carried away and swallowed my tongue

Let's go

I'm in the nuthouse
I'm in the nuthouse
I'm in the nuthouse
And they're not gonna let me out of here

I'm in the nuthouse and I don't know what I'm gonna do
I'm in the nuthouse and you know it's all because of you
I'm in the nuthouse and you know it's all because of you
