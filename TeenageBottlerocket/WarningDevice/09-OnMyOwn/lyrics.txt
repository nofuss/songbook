I got time to kill to do what I will
Now that you went away
I nearly lost my mind
But now I'm feeling fine
I hope that you're not okay
I didn't know what to tell you
I didn't know what to say to you
But now you're gone and it's on
I'm up all night long
With friends that wanted to stay

I got time to kill to do what I will
Now that you went away
I nearly lost my mind
But now I'm feeling fine
I hope that you're not okay
I didn't know what to tell you
I didn't know what to say to you
I'm having a blast now
Thank god I still remember how

Your folks don't know a thing about me
And your friends keep saying that I'm uncool
And they're right
I put in overtime to make you mine
Convince you not to hate me
Should've know I'd be better off on my own

Now and then I talk to girls again
When they listen to what I say
I think about the time I spent
Wasted on you and me
I'm better off without you
I hope that things are worse for you

Your folks don't know a thing about me
And your friends keep saying I'm uncool
And they're right
Convince you not to hate me
Should have known I'd be better off on my own
