I was never into pegging my Jordache jeans
no Members Only jacket no wallet chain
I never figured out how to humpty dance
and I never owned a pair of JNCO pants

it took a while to go out of style
hanging out with you, baby baby
always makes me smile
those dudes proclaimed they’d walk a thousand miles
just to hang out with some girl for a little while
I really like their style
you’re never going out of style

you never topsy tailed your hair
your Peggy Bundy pants match your underwеar
you never wore Elеctric Youth
when you walked around the block in your jelly shoes

it took a while to go out of style
hanging out with you, baby baby
always makes me smile
those clothes you wear always seem so versatile
if you would take my heart, I would walk a thousand miles
just to check out your style
you’re never going out of style
