You became a statistic
‘Cause you’re masochistic
You’re so sadistic
I’m gonna go ballistic
Let’s be realistic
Don’t want to be so narcissistic
Try to be optimistic
Think of something simplistic
It’s just another logistic
You became a statistic
Couldn’t wait till tomorrow
Couldn’t just stay awake
I wish that you would’ve waited
And died another day
You became a statistic
