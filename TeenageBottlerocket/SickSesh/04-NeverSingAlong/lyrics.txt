I was staring at my phone to pass the time when I’m alone
And I came across a picture of you
I wrote a couple lines under your picture to remind me
That I hate your fucking world view

But I never posted shit I chilled out for a bit
And remembered that you did me a favor
When I came back to my room the stupid picture of you
Had been displaced by the screen saver

You fell in love with another person
You found another then you tried to disperse them
And thеn you finally met a guy that would treat you right
But he was only 22

I will nеver ever ever sing along with you
You’ve taken all my favorite songs and you’ve showed ‘em to
Everyone of your friends that you know I hate
And now my favorite bands sound shitty to me

No, I’ll never ever ever sing along with you
You’ve taken all my favorite songs and you’ve showed ‘em to
Everyone of your friends that you know I hate
And now my favorite bands sound obsolete, yeah

I was hangin’ with my friends before the world came to an end
And someone took a picture of me
They put it on a page and then it put you in a rage
Because you’re not as cool as you used to be

And while we’re all gonna die and you’re starting to cry
I came up with the perfect closer
You were wearing their shirt I better give you the dirt
That band thinks you’re a poser

You fell in love with another person
You found another then you tried to disperse them
And then you finally met a guy that would treat you right
But he was only 22

And I will never ever ever sing along with you
You’ve taken all my favorite songs and you’ve showed ‘em to
Everyone of your friends that you know I hate
And now my favorite bands sound shitty to me

No, I’ll will never ever ever sing along with you
You’ve taken all my favorite songs and you’ve showed ‘em to
Everyone of your friends that you know I hate
And now my favorite bands sound obsolete, yeah
