I'm scared to death I'm destined never to succeed
I wash my hands so clean they almost start to bleed
feel like I'm gonna shit my stomach's cramped in pain
I light a smoke and pace the room and watch my life go down the drain

blood pressures up oxygen's low
I might throw up I think my brain just might explode
life is shit my head's a fucking mess
strung out on stress

my wife is always pissed she's never satisfied
my kids don't give a shit whether I live or die
I'm tired all the time 'cause I can't sleep at night
my body's starting to go numb my chest is getting tight

blood pressure's up my visions blurred
the TV news has me hanging on every word
life is shit my head's a fucking mess
strung out on stress
