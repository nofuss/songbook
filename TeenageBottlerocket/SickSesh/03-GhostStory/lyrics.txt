I didn’t mean to die in the woods that day
I was just messing around, I thought I’d be okay
Now I’m dead and gone, and I’m missing you
Need to see you again, I know just what I’ll do
I’m gonna haunt our house, you’re gonna light incense
The dogs will know I’m there ‘cause they’ve got a sixth sense
 
Gonna take a sheet, cut out holes for eyes
When you see me again you’ll get a big surprise
 
You can’t ignore the floating objects
Or the shivers down your spine
It’s true I may have left my body
But I’m not leaving you behind
 
Ghost story, and I’m haunting you
Ghost Story!
‘Cause we still have so much to do
Ghost Story!
Yes, it’s true I’m dead and you’re alive
Ghost Story!
Ghost story, and I’m always by your side
Ghost Story!
 
Making objects float, I’ll flicker the lights
When our friends drop by, gonna give them a fright
Being dead’s not bad, ‘cause I’m not alone
As long as you’re my girl, and I’m your ghost
You can’t ignore the floating objects
Or the shivers down your spine
It’s true I may have left my body
But I’m not leaving you behind
Ghost story, and I’m haunting you
Ghost Story!
‘Cause we still have so much to do
Ghost Story!
Yes, it’s true I’m dead and you’re alive
Ghost Story!
Ghost story, and I’m always by your side
Ghost Story!
Ghost story, your new boyfriend better hide
Ghost Story!
Ghost story ‘cause I’m dead and you’re alive
