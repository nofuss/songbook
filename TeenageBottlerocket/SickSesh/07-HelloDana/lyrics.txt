I never thought that I would
Meet someone like you
You were worth every lonely night and
Heart break that I went through yeah

I never knew that you were out there
Maybe lonely too
Looking for someone to love you
The way that I love you yeah
Oh, yeah

I won’t forget the night I met you
Said Judas Priest was your favorite band
I got up the balls to kiss you
And you got up the nerve to hold my hand

We talked all night and you laughed at all my
Stupid jokеs and said I was dumb and
When we said goodbye in thе morning
I knew that I had found the one and

Now that I got you
There’s nothing we can do
You’re like a dream come true
Now that I got you
I love everything about you
Don’t think I can live without you
Don’t want to live without you yeah

Now that I got you
There’s nothing we can do
You’re like a dream come true
Now that I got you
