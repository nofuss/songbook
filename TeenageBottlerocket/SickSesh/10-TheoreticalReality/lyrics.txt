[Verse 1]
What a strange time to be alive
All of my friends are in a fight
We’re wasting all our lives away
Theoretical reality

[Chorus 1]
It’s not going away, it’s here to stay
Everything that you say, even though you don’t like it
It’s here to stay, it’s not going away
Everything that you say, even though you don’t like it

[Verse 2]
I’m gonna put another record on
Before they drop another atom bomb
We’re gonna dance the night away
Yesterday was yesterday

[Chorus 2]
I’m letting it go, I’m ready to go
I’m losing control and I totally like it
I’m letting it go, I’m ready to go
I’m losing control and I totally like it now

[Bridge]
Not playing the victim of everything
Try not to be let down
They’re getting offended by everything
They’re running me out of town
And I can’t wait to hear the sound
Of a song that they’ve never found
And if they did, it would fall on deaf ears
I want to make the problem disappear
[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus 3]
It’s not going away, it’s here to stay
Everything that you say, even though you don’t like it
I’m letting it go, I’m ready to go
I’m losing control and I totally like it, yeah

[Outro]
Yeah
