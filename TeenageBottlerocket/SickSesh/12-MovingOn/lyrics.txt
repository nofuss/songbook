Never knew anything different
But there's so much out there to know
The things I love the most they don't live here
So now it's time for me to go
I'm moving on

8 long months of cold and winter
And I can't take another year
The place I called home is no longer mine
It's time for me to disappear
I'm moving on

Been holding onto something time to let go
It used to feel so right but now it's wrong
I'm getting out of here this isn't my home
This place was never mine I'm moving on
