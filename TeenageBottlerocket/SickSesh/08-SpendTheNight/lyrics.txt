I want to spend the night together
I want to be with you forever
I'm not so cold when you're lying next to me
I'm gonna tickle your back until you fall asleep
I got a feeling of love for you so strong
Even though you like snoring all night long
The sheets are fresh out the dryer
And I, I just want you to spend the night tonight
I really want you to spend the night tonight
I just want you to spend the night tonight
I really want you to spend the night tonight
The roads won't be that bad tomorrow
When you drive back to Colorado
I get a little bit hot when you're lying next to me
We'll watch whatever you want until I fall asleep
I got a feeling of love for you so strong
Even though I like snoring all night long
The sheets are fresh out the dryer
And I just want you to spend the night tonight
I really want you to spend the night tonight
I'm gonna set the alarm clock I'll wake up with you
I'll make the dogs sleep in the other room (yeah right J)
If you want to have a midnight snack in bed
Forget what I said
Pig out instead!
Let's turn on the electric blanket
And I, I just want you to spend the night tonight
I really want you to spend the night tonight
I just want you to spend the night tonight
I really want you to spend the night tonight
I just want you to spend the night tonight
I really want you to spend the night tonight
I just want you to spend the night tonight
I really want you to spend the night tonight
