You're on my mind
You're on my brain
Thought you would go away but instead you're driving me insane
You are the one
The one I think about
We've got a problem here and we're going to have to work it out
Cause how can I tell my heart that we're a million miles apart

So far away
I still think about you every day
Don't wanna call you on the telephone
I'm getting sick of being here alone
And I don't want to be alone

You're on my mind
You're on my brain
Thought you would go away but instead you're driving me insane
You are the one
Make everything alright
And I would give anything to be with you tonight
Cause how can I tell my heart that we're a million miles apart

So far away
I still think about you every day
Don't wanna call you on the telephone
I'm getting sick of being here alone
And I don't want to be alone

I didn't wanna leave I didn't wanna say goodbye
But I'll be back so baby don't you cry
Don't you cry yea

So far away
I still think about you every day
Don't wanna call you on the telephone
I'm getting sick of being here alone

So far away [x2]
So far away yea yea [x2]
So far away
