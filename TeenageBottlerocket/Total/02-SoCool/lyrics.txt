So cool, I'm into killing time with you
So cool, with all the stupid things we do
And I know that you like it too
Baby you're so cool
So cool, you hang around with me all day
And I'm hoping that it's always going to be this way
There's only one thing I can say
Baby you're so cool

So please say that you'll stay
Tell me that you'll never go away
Cause if you do I'm coming after you

So cool, baby you're so cool

So cool, you picked me up when I was down
So cool, I'm into having you around
You never treat me like a fool
Baby you're so cool
So cool, but now your boyfriend's getting pissed
Kinda funny how he doesn't know we never kissed
You know you like to make him drool
Baby you're so cool

So please say that you'll stay
Tell me that you'll never go away
Cause if you do I'm coming after you
I said if you do I'm coming after you

So cool, baby you're so cool
So cool, baby baby you're so cool
So cool, baby you're so cool
So cool, baby baby you're so cool
So cool
