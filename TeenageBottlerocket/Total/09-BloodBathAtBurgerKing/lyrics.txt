Everyday I get up early in the mourning cause I’ve got to go to work
Cause I want to go where the action is
Where everybody treats me like a jerk
I like taking shit from assholes it’s a dream come true but five
Fifteen ain’t going to pay the rent
So I short change the guy with the Whopper he complained I told
Him to get bent

But you know there will come a day
I’m gonna make these fuckers pay
Blood bath at Burger King [x2]

Blood on the register the grill and on the floor
Blood on the fryer and the walk-in cooler door [x6]

Blood bath at Burger King
