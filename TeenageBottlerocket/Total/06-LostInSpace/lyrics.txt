I knew right away that you were out of the world
When I first saw your face
My head spun like a tilt a whirl
As I tired not to puke all over the place
You seem so down to earth
But things aren't what they seem
But now it's too late
You've got my heart in your tractor beam

I can tell by the blank expression on your face
You're fucking lost in space
Your mind just up and left without a trace
You're fucking lost in space
Don't wanna thing about it too much baby
Cause if I do
I might get lost in space with you

I try to make contact but it seems
That my transmissions aren't getting through
And that's when I finally realized
There might be no hope in saving you
Our attempts are futile baby
Seems our cause is lost
This search is going nowhere
But I just can't seem to call it off

I can tell by the blank expression on your face
You're fucking lost in space
Your mind just up and left without a trace
You're fucking lost in space
Don't wanna thing about it too much baby
Cause if I do
I might get lost in space with you
I might get lost in space with you
I might get lost in space with you
