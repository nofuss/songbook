The first time I saw you
You were drinking from the pony keg
But by the end of the night
You were dirty dancing on my leg
You confessed your love to me
The night that we watched Poltergeist
And now you're telling all your friends
That I'm the anti-Christ

Hey you quit fucking with my brain
We both know you're out to drive me insane

I don't wanna play these stupid fucking games
I don't wanna play these stupid fucking games
I'm not gonna play these stupid fucking games with you
I don't wanna play these stupid fucking games
I don't wanna play these stupid fucking games
I'm not gonna play these stupid fucking games with you
