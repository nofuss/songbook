Never thought that hanging out
Was gonna give me a feeling like this
Never thought you would take my heart
I had a feeling that wouldn't accept it
It's totally cool that you and I
Are gonna spend a lot of time together
We'll do anything that you want
Stay at home or do whatever
[x2]

When you wake I want to wake up right beside you
When you laugh I want to be the one who made you
If you're cold I'll let you wear my Ramones sweatshirt
If you fall I'm gonna make sure that you're not hurt
Won't you fall, fall for me

Never thought that breaking up
Was gonna give me a feeling like this
Never thought you would break my heart
Turn and give yours back to your boyfriend
Is there a chance for you and I
Are we gonna get back together?
It's only been a couple days
I hopes its not forever

When you wake I want to wake up right beside you
When you laugh I want to be the one who made you
If you're cold I'll let you wear my Ramones sweatshirt
If you fall I'm gonna make sure that you're not hurt
Wont you fall, fall for me
Wont you fall, fall for me
I want you to fall for me ooh whoa oh oh
Want you to fall for me ooh whoa oh oh
