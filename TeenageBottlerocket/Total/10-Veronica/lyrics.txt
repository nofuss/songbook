Sometimes I like it when you stay
Sometimes I like it when you go away
Sometimes I like it when you check me out
It’s ready or not you send me on my way
I want to ask you on a date
Each and ever other night and day
I want to ask you how you scream and bleed its all in between
You send me on my way each waking day cuz

She turned around and said Veronica
Sunburned in my swimsuit when I was mowing my back lawn
Do you wanna wanna wanna wannica
Find out how far we’ve really gone
