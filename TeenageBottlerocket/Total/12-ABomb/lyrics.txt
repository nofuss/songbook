If you don't shut your mouth he'll shut it for you
Don't poke your fun at him he's got a short fuse
If he blows up you can count on going down
His atomic blasts enough to kill the whole town

Hiroshima will seem like a cherry bomb
Nagasaki is nothing next to this one
His aftershock will pull up trees from their roots
It will smash your windows and put your car on your roof

He's an A Bomb
He's an A Bomb
He's an A Bomb
He's an A Bomb

He's an A Bomb
He's an A Bomb
He's an A Bomb
He's an A Bomb
