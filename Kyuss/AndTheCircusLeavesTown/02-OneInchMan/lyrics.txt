One inch man, lonely soul
Two inch man, two inch man, gimme more
Five steps back, get him back
Three steps up, get him up
Always so lonely, lonely, lonely
Always so lonely, lonely, lonely

One inch man, lonely soul
Two inch man, gimme more, more, more, more
Always so lonely, lonely, lonely
Once inch man he's so lonely, oh he's breathin'

Damn my fight for you, do you really wanna fuck me
Love my time for you, do you really wanna hold me
Damn my time for you, do you really wanna to hold me
Love my time for you, do you really wanna

Always so lonely, once inch man, he's breathin'
Always so lonely, lonely, lonely
Once inch man, he's so lonely, oh!
