One inch man, lonely soul
Two inch man, two inch man, gimme more
Five steps back, get him back
Three steps up, get him up
Always so lonely, lonely, lonely
Always so lonely, lonely, lonely

One inch man, lonely soul
Two inch man, gimme more, more, more, more
Always so lonely, lonely, lonely
Once inch man he's so lonely, oh he's breathin'

Down my vice (??), do you really want to fuck me
Not my time (type?), do you really want to hold me
Am I time (type?), do you really want to hold me
Love my time (type?), do you really want to hold me

Always so lonely, once inch man, he's breathin'
Always so lonely, lonely, lonely
Once inch man, he's so lonely, oh!
