 See the young ones play
 And say what you want to hear

 You have a long legs, long hair
 Big tits, you got a big ass
 Your pots will never last, never last

 See the young ones say, well and play
 What they want to hear from you

 You say you're not fucking with them
 You say they're not fucking with you
 Compete with them and you'll never win, never win

 Well, it's cold where we come from
 But not to make me freeze
 I look around me at what I see
 The world deeper than before

 There's been a change in me
 Things are looking pretty blurry
 I keep on wishing she would awake me
 And tell me it was just a bad dream
 But I guess you're gonna be awakened
 Well, your already wakened to reality, yeah
