I'm not,
Ready to leave this world.
Bring as big a people,
Well no one told me about them.

Sometimes, well it doesn't seem to matter,
But I'll make mine a good one.
Up with the clouds of hate.

Only,
time,
will tell,
Time, will tell.
Will tell.

I'm not,
Ready to leave this world.
Bring as big a people.
Well no one told me about them.

Sometimes, well it doesn't seem to matter,
But I'll make mine a good one.
Up with the clouds of hate yeah...

Well only,
Time,
Will tell,
Well only
Time, will tell.
Well only time.

Takin' it yourself,
Well only time will tell.

Only,

Well only time will tell.
Well only time will tell.

Well I'm not,
Ready to leave this world.
Bring as big a people,
Well no one told me about them.

Sometimes, well it doesn't seem to matter,
But I'll make mine a good one.
Up with the clouds of hate yeah...

Only.
Time
Will tell
