Look into my face now
Stare into my eyes
Hellfire in my veins
in my veins
in my veins
in my vein, yeah.

I can see through your eyes,
Its no disguise to me,
I can see through the lies,
No one can make a fool of me.

Drowning in your lonliness,
Want to bring me down with you.
No one buys your innocence,
Gonna' break your walls in two.
Well in two,
Well in two.

No one buys it,
No one wanted to,
With you,
You,
Fuck you.

Dig your grave for two.

Walk my way,
Get out of my way.
Well I wanted you,
I saw right through ya.
Well I'm your man,
You'll understand,
You'll pay the price,
To live in a paradise.

Look into my face now,
Stare into my eyes.
Hellfire in my veins,
In my veins,
In my veins,
In my vein yeah.

I can see through your eyes,
Well its no disguise to me.
I can see through the lies,
No one can make a fool of me.

I'm drowning in your lonliness,
Want to bring me down with you.
No one buys your innocence,
Gonna break your walls in two.
Well in two,
Well in two.

Well no one buys it,
No one wanted to,
With you,
You,
Fuck you.

Dig your grave for two.
