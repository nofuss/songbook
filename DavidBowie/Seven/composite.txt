I forgot what my father said

I forgot what my mother said

As we layed upon her bed

A city full of flowers
Ab  Am  
A city full of rain
Ab  F   
I got seven days to live my life

I forgot what my brother said
C   G   
I forgot what he said
Am  F   
I don't regret anything at all
C   G   
I remember how we wept 
Am  F

On a bridge of violent people
Ab  Am  
I was small enough to cry
Ab  F   

I got seven days to live my life 
C   G   
or seven ways to die

Hold my face before you

Still my trembling heart

Seven days to live my life

or seven ways to die

The Gods forgot they made me
C   G   
So I forget them, too
Am  F   
I listen to their shadows
C   G   
I play among their graves
Am  F

My heart is never broken
Ab  Am  
My patience never tried
Ab  F   
I got seven days to live my life 
C   G   
or seven ways to die
Am  F   

Seven days to live my life 
C   G   
or seven ways to die
