Goodbye love

Didn't know what time it was the lights were low oh oh
I leaned back on my radio oh oh
Some cat was layin down some rock n roll lotta soul, he said

Then the loud sound did seem to fade a ade
Came back like a slow voice on a wave of phase ha hase
That werent no d.j. that was hazy cosmic jive

There's a starman waiting in the sky
Hed like to come and meet us
But he thinks he'd blow our minds

There's a starman waiting in the sky
Hes told us not to blow it
Cause he knows it's all worthwhile
He told me:

Let the children lose it
Let the children use it
Let all the children boogie

I had to phone someone so I picked on you ho ho
Hey, that's far out so you heard him too! o o
Switch on the tv we may pick him up on channel two

Look out your window I can see his light a ight
If we can sparkle he may land tonight a ight
Don't tell your poppa or he'll get us locked up in fright

There's a starman waiting in the sky
Hed like to come and meet us
But he thinks he'd blow our minds

There's a starman waiting in the sky
Hes told us not to blow it
Cause he knows it's all worthwhile
He told me:

Let the children lose it
Let the children use it
Let all the children boogie

Starman waiting in the sky
Hed like to come and meet us
But he thinks he'd blow our minds

There's a starman waiting in the sky
Hes told us not to blow it
Cause he knows it's all worthwhile
He told me:

Let the children lose it
Let the children use it
Let all the children boogie

La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
