Youve got your mother in a whirl
Shes not sure if you're a boy or a girl
Hey babe, your hairs alright
Hey babe, lets go out tonight
You like me, and I like it all
We like dancing and we look divine
You love bands when they're playing hard
You want more and you want it fast
They put you down, they say Im wrong
You tacky thing, you put them on

Rebel rebel, your face is a mess
Rebel rebel, how could they know? 
Hot tramp, I love you so!

You can't get enough, but enough aint the test
Youve got your transmission and your live wire
You got your cue line and a handful of ludes
You wanna be there when they count up the dudes
And I love your dress
Youre a juvenile success
Because your face is a mess
So how could they know?

Calamitys child, chi-chile, chi-chile
Whered you wanna go? 
What can I do for you? looks like youve been there too
Cause youve torn your dress
And your face is a mess
Oh, your face is a mess

Eh, eh, how could they know?
