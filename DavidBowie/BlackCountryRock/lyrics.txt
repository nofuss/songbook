[Verse]
Pack a pack horse up and rest up here on
Black Country Rock
You never know, you might find it here
On Black Country Rock
Pack a pack horse up and rest up here on
Black Country Rock
You never know, you might find it here
On Black Country Rock

[Chorus]
Some say the view is crazy
But you may adopt another point of view
So if it's much too hazy
You can leave my friend and me with fond "À Dieu"

[Verse]
Pack a pack horse up and rest up here on
Black Country Rock
You never know, you might find it here
On Black Country Rock
Pack a pack horse up and rest up here on
Black Country Rock
Never know, you might find it here
On Black Country Rock

[Chorus]
Some say the view is crazy
But you may adopt another point of view
So if it's much too hazy
You can leave my friend and me with fond "À Dieu"

[Outro]
Some say the view is crazy
But you may adopt another point of view
So if it's much too hazy
You can leave my friend and me with fond "À Dieu"
Ah!
