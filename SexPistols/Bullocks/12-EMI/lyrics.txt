There's unlimited supply
And there is no reason why
I tell you it was all a frame
They only did it 'cause of fame
Who?

E.M.I.
E.M.I.
E.M.I.

Too many people had the suss
Too many people support us
An unlimited amount
Too many outlets in and out
Who?

E.M.I.
E.M.I.
E.M.I.

And sir and friends are crucified
A day they wished that we had died
We are an addition we are ruled by none
Never ever never

And you thought that we were faking
That we were all just money making
You do not believe we're for real
Or you would lose your cheap appeal?

Don't judge a book just by the cover
Unless you cover just another
And blind acceptance is a sign
A stupid fools who stand in line
Like

E.M.I.
E.M.I.
E.M.I.

Unlimited edition
With an unlimited supply
That was the only reason
We all had to say goodbye

Unlimited supply E.M.I
There is no reason why E.M.I.
I tell you it was all a frame E.M.I.
They only did it 'cause of fame E.M.I.
I do not need the pressure E.M.I.
I can't stand the useless fools E.M.I.
Unlimited supply E.M.I.
Hallo E.M.I., goodbye A & M
