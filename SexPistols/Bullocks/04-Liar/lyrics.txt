Lie lie lie lie liar you lie
Lie lie lie lie tell me why tell me why
Why d'you have to lie
Should've realised that
You should've told the truth
Should've realised
You know what I'll do

You're in suspension
You're a liar

Now I wanna know know know know
I wanna know why you never look me
In the face
Broke a confidence just to please
Your ego
Should've realised
You know what I know

You're in suspension
You're a liar

I know where you go everybody you know
I know everything that you do or say
So when you tell lies
I'll always be in your way
I'm nobody's fool
And I know all 'cos I know
What I know

You're in suspension
You're a liar 
you're a liar

A lie lie lie lie lie lie lie lie lie

Lie lie lie lie
Liar you lie lie lie lie lie
I think you're funny

Should've realised
I know what you are

You're in suspension
You're in suspension
You're in suspension
You're a liar

You're a lie
You're a lie
You're a lie
