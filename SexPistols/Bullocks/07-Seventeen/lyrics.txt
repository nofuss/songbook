You're only twenty-nine
Gotta lot to learn
But when your mummy dies
She will not return

We like noise it's our choice
It's what we want to do
We don't care about long hair
I don't wear flares

See my face not a trace
No reality
Oh I don't work, I just speed
That's all I need

I'm a lazy sod
I'm a lazy sod
I'm a lazy sod
I'm so lazy

I'm a lazy sod
I'm a lazy sod
I'm a lazy sod
I'm so lazy

I can't even be bothered
Lazy
Lazy
