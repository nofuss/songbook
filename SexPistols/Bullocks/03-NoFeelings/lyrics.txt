I've seen you in the mirror
When the story began
And I fell in love with you.
I love yer mortal sin

Yer brains are locked away
But I love your company
I only ever leave you
When you got no money

I got no emotions for anybody else
You better understand
I'm in love with myself, myself
My beautiful self

A-no feelings
A-no feelings
A-no feelings
For anybody else

Hello and goodbye
And a run around Sue
You follow me around
Like a pretty pot of glue
I kick you in the head
You got nothing to say
Get out of the way
Cause I gotta get away

You never realize
I take the piss out of you
You come up and see me
And I'll beat you black and blue okay
I'll send you away

I got no feelings
A-no feelings
A-no feelings
For anybody else
(Except for myself
My beautiful self dear)

There ain't no moonlight
After midnight
I see you stupid people
Out looking for delight
Well I'm so happy
I'm feeling so fine
I'm watching all the rubbish
You're wasting my time

I look around your house
And there's nothing to steal
I kick you in the brains
When you get down to kneel and pray
You pray to your God

A-no feelings
A-no feelings
A-no feelings
For anybody else

A-no feelings
A-no feelings
A-no feelings
For anybody else

Except for myself
Your daddy's gone away
Be back another day
See his picture hanging on your wall
