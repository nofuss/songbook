Well my baby drove off in a brand new Cadillac
Ooh, my baby drove off in a brand new Cadillac
Well she looked at me, daddy, I ain't never comin' back

I said baby-baby-baby won't you listen to me
Come on sugar, come on hear my plea
Well she looked at my Ford, we'll never agree
Cadillac car! Oh yeah!

Well the Caddy's rollin' and going 'bout ninety-five
Well the Caddy's rollin' and going 'bout ninety-five
Well me and my Ford, we're right by here side

I said baby-baby-baby won't you listen to me
Come on baby, come on hear my plea
Turn that big car around, come on back to me
Hangin' on Scotty, here we go!

Well my baby took off in a brand new Cadillac
Ooh, my baby took off in a brand new Cadillac
Well she looked at me, daddy, I ain't never comin' back

I ain't never comin' back
I ain't never comin' back
I ain't never comin' back
