Patronize the living, in a dark and dying world
Recognizing evil as a darkened tale unfolds
Will you come out?

Satisfy the urges with a quick and mindless set
Falsify the data as a hard truth goes unmet
Rectify the image as your word and mind are barred
Crawling on your hands and knees as a war torn world is scared

Will you come?
Will you come out and play?
Will you die?
Dying of everything
Patronize the living, in a dark and dying world
Recognizing evil as a darkened tale unfolds

You will
You will find yourself
You will find yourself living in the dark
Fearing your every move
And as you heart beats
Pounding out your ch–µst
You'll find your only choice is death
