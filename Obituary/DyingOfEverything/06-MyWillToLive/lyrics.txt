Bury me with a cross, with the cross tide
My will
Sentence me to the sand, liquify
My will to live
My will to live

(Sentence me, sentence me)
Sentence me to a land on the dark side
My deal
Carry me through the sand, petrified
My deal to give
My deal to give

Bury me with a cross, in a cross tide
My will
Sentence me to the sand, liquify
My will to live
My will to live
