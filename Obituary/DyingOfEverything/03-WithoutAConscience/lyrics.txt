I'll put an end to you
Put an end to you

Without the price of free speech ratings, I'll put an end to you
Within the price of blood spilled feedings, I'll put an end to you

Without a conscience
Without fear
Without a conscience

Without the price of free speech ratings, I'll put an end to you
Within the price of blood spilled feedings, I'll put an end to you
Back into the free fall thinking and back into the ground
I'll put an end to free speech ratings, I'll put an end to you

Without a conscience
Without fear
Without a conscience
Without a conscience

Within the price of free speech ratings, I'll put an end to you
Within the price of blood spilled beatings, I'll put an end
I'll put an end to you

Without a conscience
Without a conscience
I'll put an end to you
I'll put an end to you
