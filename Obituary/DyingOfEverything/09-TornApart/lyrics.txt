Lost, inside my head
Cry, in pain
Gone, gone insane
Feel, feelings be gone
Be gone

Lack, of control
Fear, unknown
Gone, half insane
Fall, you're falling apart
Apart

Lost inside my head
Feelings of half dead
Lost inside my mind
Leaving all behind

Lost, inside my head
Feelings of half dead
Lost inside my mind
Leaving all behind
Once you fail inside
Feelings will collide
As you fall apart
Beginning a new start
