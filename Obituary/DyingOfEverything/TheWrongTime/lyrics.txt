[Verse 1]
blood red, eastern pearl
perish to the ground
commith living Hell
witness life

[Chorus]
the right mindset
the wrong time
the right mindset

[Post-Chorus]

third world
panic street

[Chorus]
the right mindset
the wrong time
the right mindset

[Verse 2]
blood red, rivers flow
flooded with the dead
wartime fueling hate
ending life

[Bridge]

right of dead
resist my hand
reign

[Chorus]
the right mindset
the wrong time
the right mindset

[Post-Chorus]
c–µll block
third world
panic street

the right mindset
the wrong time
the right mindset

the right mindset
