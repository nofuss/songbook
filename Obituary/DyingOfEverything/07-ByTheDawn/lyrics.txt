I'll kill the diseased and rotted
And lives of those betrayed
I live to seek a challenge
Define their cause of death

By the dawn

Enlist the thieves and broken
And rise the new divide
I'll find a home in dead land
Confined to common ground

By the dawn
By the dawn

You live in the absence of thought
And find no one that cares
I see the eyes of blind men
Defined by common law

I'll kill for the fun of killing
And laugh when most would cry
Alone in my connections
And lies to justify
