Parity within sanctions set spread wings of hell endured
Calculated breeding's by words set scribed in stone

Buried Alive

Violence spread and kings are killed as thieves now rule the land
Ratify the call with a sleight cold blood of hand
I will oversee your death

Electrifying static charged with a source to realign
Falsify a sentence in his bid to redeploy
Listed in the gates to hell feel the flamed fire burned the dеad
Panic, in a dying world where seasidе soles are feed
Buried Alive
Barely Alive
Barely Survive
