Why don't you decide?
You're sentenced left to die
With soul's deceptions hole
And narrow-minded malt
Introubled through deceptive times
The mystic dreams have brought my mind to

Insane
Insane

With soul's incert decent
The corpse is still alive
Evade by your driving sense
Revolved by the noise
Forever HIp Hip Hurray
