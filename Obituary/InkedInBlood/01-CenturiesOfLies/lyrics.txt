Through the course, frozen in time
Through your rights I see lies!
I'm the one you see
I'm the one to find
I'm the course of these lies!
Through this transcend, killing time
Through this time I fall out!
With the end, your fucking ghastly stare
Desperation comes out!
I'm the one you see, I'm the one to find
I'm the course of these lies!
Now clear, is to die in fear
In the end you'll find lies!

With patience, with patience goes life!
With sentence, with sentence comes death!

Through the course,frozen time
Through your rights I see lies!

With the end your fucking ghastly stare
Desperation comes out!
I'm the one you see, I'm the one to find
I'm the course of the lies!
