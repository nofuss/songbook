One per seen, any given day
Will land the timer is won?
With paralyzing fury
To me itâ€™s due the government's fall

An uncontained, vicious, violent force
Takes the common sense of your sight
Unpromising ears, all the avoided years
We calculated centuries full of lies!
Lies!

Pharisee upon the living dead
The ground is forced to peak up
Will the latest do a violent stance
And score pitch blacks, all glow in the face of lies?
Lies!

Lies! Lies!

Slapped in the face in a rising hole
Delivered a speech through my fear
To celebrate the moments
The wind infiltrates your fears

A calculated with the time to stand
They came in all their free will
Penetrating alliance
Dominance, bring up or deal your lies!
Lies!

One per seen, any given day
Will land the timer is won?
The dominating feeling
You catch yourself
Catch yourself in your lies!
Lies!
