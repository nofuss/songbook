Well back in time enough justified
As I'm free to seek the unknown
Crawled inside as I realized
And I fought with these, these visions in my head

[Verse 1]
Lost with time
A near scare
A feat that’s rare
Rare dark hole
Where stone and terror sells
That bleeds death through the bone

[Chorus 2]
Lost your time is up
Set aside and out
Free to seek the undead
Blood bodies me
Blinded walls
They trap and call
And visions in my head

[Verse 2]
Lost with time
As cold veins and blood stains
A dark hole where stone and terror sells
That bleeds death through the bone

[Chorus 3]
Well back in time enough justified
As I’m free to seek the undead
Crawled inside as I realized
And I fought with these visions in my head
