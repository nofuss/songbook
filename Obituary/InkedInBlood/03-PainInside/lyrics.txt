back to front, front to back
life is killing us all
gone is the time, pain by life
the future cursed his soul

all we need is pain inside
all we need is pain
all we need is the pain that divides
all we need is pain inside

front to back, back to front
leaving the unknown
gone in time, pain with lies
the future cursed our soul

gone is the way, the ways of life
leaving all for dead
the common ground, passing time
woe to your last words

all we need is the pain inside
all we need is pain
all we need is the pain that divides
all we need is pain

I'm coming to get you
I'm coming to get you, and your
I'm coming to get you
I'm coming to get you, and your
soul

I'm coming to get you, and your
I'm coming to get you, and your
soul

all we need is pain inside
all we need is pain
all we need is the pain the divine
all we need is pain

I'm coming to get you, and your
I'm coming to get you, and your
soul
