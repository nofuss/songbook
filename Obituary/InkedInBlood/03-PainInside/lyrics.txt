all we need is the pain that divides
all we need is pain inside


front to back, back to front

leaving the unknown

gone in time, pain with lies

the future cursed his soul


gone is the way, the ways of life

leaving all for dead

the common ground, passing time

woe his last words


all we need is pain inside
all we need is pain

all we need is the pain that divides
all we need is pain


I'm coming to get you

I'm coming to get you, and you

I'm coming to get you

I'm coming to get you and your


soul


I'm coming to get you, and you

I'm coming to get you, and your

soul


all we need is pain inside
all we need is pain

all we need is the pain the divine
all we need is pain


I'm coming to get you

I'm coming to get you, and you

I'm coming to get you

I'm coming to get you and your
