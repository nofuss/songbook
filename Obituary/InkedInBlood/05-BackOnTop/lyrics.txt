in the dead of night
the truth is far from sight
I am truth it is what I say

with no end in sight
the truth is black and white
back on top I plan to stay

walk my way

back in time is said
the thought of victory is dead
as the truth begins to fade

the battle plan has failed
when brother's blood is spilled
there is now none but my way

walk my way

walk my way
