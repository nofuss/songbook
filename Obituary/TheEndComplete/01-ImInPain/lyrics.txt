the killing is a need, rots in the pain
fight for the fear of rights
the time is set, scream for their help
cry through the darkest nights

the peeling is the skin rotting the soul
hailing for the chosen son
mortality the pain, fearing for the living
ravenge the chosen one

the darkness falls beyond the grave
blessed ground in which they save
even though the time has passed
their souls are fried tonight in hell

rotting souls in fear of desperate need
serpent souls in bowels on which to feed
the devil dog is out for blood and parts
the devil craves the blood we're thirsting on

help me! I'm in pain!
help me! I'm in pain!
