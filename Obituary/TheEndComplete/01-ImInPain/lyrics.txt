You will soon come with me to die
And find that death is not the end

Who I say, who will, who won't be freed
Tell me that this is not the end complete

Even as the end's complete
Finding strenght in one's defeat
Living in an endless score
Killing me with battled sores
I'm the one that's sent to kill
Feeling all destructive will
Bring forth one dead soul's decay
The end's complete, it's the final day

When the time has come to bare
Dying young, fall to despair
To bring forth one dead soul decay
The end complete's the final day
