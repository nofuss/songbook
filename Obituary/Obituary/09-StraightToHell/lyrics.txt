I'm goin' straight to Hell
On a one-night train
We're goin' straight to Hell
In a blood-born rage

Stand down (Stand down)
Go on and give it to me
In a peaceful way

I'm goin' straight to Hell
On a one-man stand
We're goin' straight to Hell
With a poisoned hand

[?] days gone past
When I see it's gone south
Another deal gone bad
Of a man gone mad

Stand down (Stand down)
Come on and give it to me
In a peaceful way
I'm goin' straight to Hell 

Gonna let your head hang down
Put another bullet in
Gonna let your head hang down
Put another bullet in
Gonna let your head hang down
Put another bullet in
Gonna let your head hang down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down
