Who says now?
I say now
I say when

Who says now?
I say now
End this now

End this soon
I say when
I say now

End this now
Stop this pain
End it now

I say now
End this now
End it now

Please
End this now

Please
End this now

Please
End this now

End this now
End this now

In a stone-cold world
In the pouring rain

End this now
End this now
End it now

Please
End this now
End this now
End this now

In a stone-cold world
In the pouring rain
No chance for solace
No chance for change

Please
End this now
End this now
End this now

Please
End this now
End this now
End this now

In a stone-cold world
In the pouring rain
No chance for solace
No chance for change
In a dead man's world
Through a dead man's eyes
In a quest for something
I'm something you're not

Please
End this now
End this now
End this now
