it lives
as night falls to you
as night falls to you

it lives
as night falls to you
as death marches through ?
it lives unto you
woh, it lives

it lives
as night falls it's true
as night falls to you

woh
ow

in self defense
my days are done
no self control
my days are done ?

no self control
when the days gone past
win an argument
Where the dead men stand
