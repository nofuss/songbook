In battle has fallen
My hate fills the tide
A lesson in vengeance
A lesson in one

Just give me something
Just give me a sign
My future has darkened
With future is not
With one foot in darkness
And one in the grave

Just give me something
Just give me a sign
With future in darkness
That's what all the lie

Just give me something
Just give me a sign
One fortunate reading
One fortunate lie

Just give me something
Just give me a sign
One fortunate reading
One fortunate lie
