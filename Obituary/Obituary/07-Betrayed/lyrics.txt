yeah!

come here, one more victim's down
slipping deaper into dawn
the terror back until the sun
the dying and betrayed

what they do with darkness
what are you doing?

the fallen, back until it's done
live in dying peaceful reign
witness, will encased and soul
a love encased so cold

I'll leave you in darkness
I'll lock you away
less fortunate healings
the pale and betrayed

what they do with darkness
I'll lock you away
less fortunate healings
less fortunate pain
