the day becomes the night
night turns to day
the feeding time at last
lust within the past

down
down
down

listening to a drug
you kneel across the bowl
tell me what you will
resist the urge to kill

drowning hope, we've got to give
I will come, come to feed
drowning hope, we've got to give
drowning hope, we've got to
ending hope, I try to
filling it, with time to serve

drowning hope, we've got to give
drowning hope, got to give
ending hope, I try to 
finding hope, I'll give to 
seeking hope, we fail to
slowly grow
