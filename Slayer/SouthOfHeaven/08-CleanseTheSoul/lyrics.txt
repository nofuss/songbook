Body that rests before me
With every dying breath
Spellbound and gagged
I commence your flesh to dirt

Body that lay before me
In everlasting death
Entombed in an abscess
To rot and lie stinking in the Earth

Empty altar awaits its victim, stained glass windows black
Candles burn the midnight oil, incense fills the night
Observing trance awaking state, lying still unknowing
Reciting the passages of time, prepare for the impaling

Death's an art, flesh and earth never part, a power of the mind
Death shines on the air of silence, a ritual of endless time
Purged of your dead body, sacrificed of your life
Unearthly ritual sealed in fire, enter the kingdom of desire
