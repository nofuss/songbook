[Verse 1]
I am the new hell on earth
The lord of agony divine
Domination, intimidation
Lives within these eyes
Reign of power
Remorseless anarchy
I am arrogance in the flesh
Unleashed intensity

[Chorus]
Step aside for the nightmare
Pure destruction stands before you
No escape as the psycho
Brings you misery
The line starts here
The line starts here

[Verse 2]
I am brutality, the face of everlasting pain
Annihilation, obliteration
Pulses in these veins
Sheer defiance drives my hostility
I am merciless to the core
Chaotic fury breeds

[Chorus]
Step aside for the nightmare
Pure destruction stands before you
No escape as the psycho
Brings you misery
The line starts here
The line starts here

[Bridge 1]
Bring it all on
Come and take on what you fear
I'm the storm
That towers overhead
Ticking time bomb
With an infinite charge
Bringer of torture
The master is here
Everyone falls

[Lead - King and Hanneman]

[Bridge 2]
Here comes the pain
You're no different from the rest
Victim is your name in my vicious wasteland
Here comes the pain
Your destruction manifests
Lying there broken, looking up as I still stand
[Bridge 1]
Bring it all on
Come and take on what you fear
I'm the storm
That towers overhead
Ticking time bomb
With an infinite charge
Bringer of torture
The master is here
Everyone falls
