PT boat on the way to Havana
I used to make a living, man
Pickin' the banana
Now I'm a guide for the CIA
Hooray! for the USA

Baby baby make me loco
Baby baby make me mambo

Sent to spy on a Cuban talent show
First stop, Havana go go!
I used to make a living, man
Pickin' the banana
Hooray! For Havana

Baby baby make me loco
Baby baby make me mambo
