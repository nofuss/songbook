Hey baby won't you take a chance.
Say that you'll let me have this dance.

Well let's dance, let's dance.
We'll do the twist, the stomp,
The mashed potatoes too
Any old dance that you want to do.
Well let's dance, well let's dance.

Hey baby yeah you thrill the soul
Hold me tight, never let me go.

Well let's dance, let's dance
We'll do the twist, the stomp,
The mashed potatoes too
Any old dance that you want to do
Well let's dance, well let's dance

Hey baby if you're all alone
Baby you'll let me walk you home

Well let's dance, let's dance
We'll do the twist, the stomp,
The mashed potatoes too
Any old dance that you want to do
Well let's dance, well let's dance
Hey baby yeah you swing it right
Yes I know that tonight's the night

Well let's dance, let's dance.
We'll do the twist, the stomp,
The mashed potatoes too
Any old dance that you want to do
Well let's dance, well let's dance
Well let's dance, well let's dance
