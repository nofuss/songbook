Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Sitting here with nothin' to do
Sitting here thinkin' only of you
But you'll never get out of there
She'll never get out of there

Sitting here with nothin' to do

They took my baby away from me
But she'll never get out of there
She'll never get out of there

She told me told me told me told me
She wouldn't go far
Ooh, now I know I'm so much in love
'Cause she's the only girl that I'm ever thinking of

Texas chain saw massacre
They took my baby away from me
But she'll never get out of there
