I saw her walking down the street
He jumped down, he knocked her off her feet
And then I knew it was the end of her
(one two three four)

He's gonna kill that girl
He's gonna kill that girl
He's gonna kill that girl tonight

(Hey) He's gonna kill that girl
(Hey) He's gonna kill that girl
(Hey) He's gonna kill that girl tonight

When I saw her walking down the street
My heart stood still and skipped a beat
Then he knocked her on the floor
But he wanted a little bit more

(Hey) He's gonna kill that girl
(Hey) He's gonna kill that girl
(Hey) He's gonna kill that girl tonight

(Hey) He's gonna kill that girl
(Hey) He's gonna kill that girl
(Hey) He's gonna kill that girl tonight

When I saw her walking down the street
My heart stood still and skipped a beat
Then he knocked her on the floor
But he wanted a little bit more

I saw her lying on the street
He jumped down he knocked her off her feet
And then I knew it was the end of her
(one two three four)

(Hey) He's gonna kill that girl
(Hey) He's gonna kill that girl
(Hey) He's gonna kill that girl tonight

(Hey) He's gonna kill that girl
(Hey) He's gonna kill that girl
(Hey) He's gonna kill that girl tonight

When I saw her walking down the street
My heart stood still and skipped a beat
Then he knocked her on the floor
But he wanted a little bit more

Kill kill kill kill kill that girl, he's gonna
Kill kill kill kill kill that girl, he's gonna
Kill kill kill kill kill that girl, he's gonna
Kill kill kill kill kill that girl, he's gonna

Kill kill kill kill kill that girl, he's gonna
Kill kill kill kill kill that girl, he's gonna
Kill kill kill kill kill that girl, he's gonna
Kill
