Winter is here and it's going on two years
Swallow my pride
And things were lookin' grim
But they're lookin' good again
Swallow my pride

Loose lips sink ships, they said
But isn't it always that way?
Swallow my pride, oh yeah
Swallow my pride, oh yeah
Swallow my pride, oh yeah

Winter is here and it's goin' on two years
Swallow my pride
And things were lookin' very grim
But they're lookin' good again
Swallow my pride

Oh, gonna have a real cool time
And everything's gonna be real fine
Swallow my pride, oh yeah
Swallow my pride, oh yeah
Swallow my pride, oh yeah

Winter is here and it's goin' on two years
Swallow my pride
And things were lookin' grim
But they're lookin' good again
Swallow my pride

Oh, gonna have a real cool time
And everything's gonna be real fine
Swallow my pride, oh yeah
Swallow my pride, oh yeah
Swallow my pride, oh yeah
