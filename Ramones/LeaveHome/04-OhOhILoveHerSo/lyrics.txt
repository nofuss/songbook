I met her at the 'Burger King'
We fell in love by the soda machine
So we took the car down town
The kids were hanging out all around
Then we went down to the Coney Island
On the coaster and around again
And no one's gonna ever tear us apart
'Cause she's my sweetheart
All right, oh yea

Oh, oh, I love her so
Oh, oh, I love her so
Oh, oh, I love her so
Oh

Oh, oh, I love her so
Oh, oh, I love her so
Oh, oh, I love her so
Oh

Hanging out on a night like this
I'm gonna give her a great big kiss
I'm gonna make her mine
And everything's gonna be real fine
