Well I'm goin' out west where I belong
Where the days are short and the nights are long

And I'll walk and they'll walk
I'll twist and they'll twist
And I'll shimmy and they'll shimmy
And I'll fly and they'll fly
Were out there havin' fun, in the warm California sun

Well I'm goin' out west out on the coast
Well the California girls are really the most

And I'll walk and they'll walk
I'll twist and they'll twist
I'll shimmy and they'll shimmy
I'll fly and they'll fly
We were out there having fun, in the warm California sun

The girls are frisky in old 'Frisco
A pretty little chick wherever you go

Ohh, and I'll walk and they'll walk
I'll twist and they'll twist
And I'll shimmy and they'll shimmy
And I'll fly and they'll fly
We were out there having fun, in the warm California sun
We were out there havin' fun, in the warm California sun
