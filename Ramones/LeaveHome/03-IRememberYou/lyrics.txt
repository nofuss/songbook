I remember you, ooo ooo ooo
I remember you, ooo ooo ooo
I remember you, ooo ooo ooo

I remember lyin' awake at night and thinkin' just of you
But things don't last forever and somehow baby
They never really do
They never really do

I remember you, ooo ooo ooo
I remember you, ooo ooo ooo
I remember you, ooo ooo ooo

I remember lyin' awake at night and thinkin' just of you
But things don't last forever and somehow baby
They never really do
They never really do

I remember you, ooo ooo ooo
I remember you, ooo ooo ooo
I remember you, ooo ooo ooo

I remember you
I remember you
I remember you
I remember you

You, ooo ooo ooo
I remember you, ooo ooo ooo
I remember you, ooo ooo ooo

I remember lyin' awake at night and thinkin' just of you
But things don't last forever and somehow baby
They never really do
They never really do

I remember you, ooo ooo ooo
I remember you, ooo ooo ooo
I remember you, ooo ooo ooo

I remember you
I remember you
I remember you
I remember you
