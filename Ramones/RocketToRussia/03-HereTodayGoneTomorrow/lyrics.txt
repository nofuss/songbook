Oh oh oh, oh oh oh
I love you
Oh, oh oh oh, oh oh oh
I love you
I do, I do

Oh, oh oh oh, oh oh oh
I love you
Oh, oh oh oh, oh oh oh
I love you
I do, I do

But I told you why we just can't make it
I want you still but just can't take it
The time has come we oughta break it
Someone has to pay the price

Oh, oh oh oh, oh oh oh
It's over
Oh, oh oh oh, oh oh oh
It's over
It's true, it's true

Oh, oh oh oh, oh oh oh
It's over
Oh, oh oh oh, oh oh oh
It's over
It's true, it's true

And I think of times we were together
As time went on it seemed forever
But times have changed now things are better
Someone had to pay the price

And I think of times we were together
As time went on it seemed forever
But times have changed now things are better
Someone had to pay the price
