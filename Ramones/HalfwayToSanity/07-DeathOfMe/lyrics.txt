We've got to stop this crazy carrying on
It's gonna be the death of you
Stop this crazy carrying on
It's gonna be the death of me

It's gonna be the end you see
It's gonna be the death of we

If we don't stop this crazy carrying on
It's gonna be the death of you
Stop this crazy carrying on
It's gonna be the death of me

It's gonna be the end you see
It's gonna be the death of me

And I feel like I'm gonna die
I don't feel so good inside
Why baby, why, why, why?
But I had a good time, you know I had a good night

If we've got to stop this crazy carrying on
It's gonna be the death of you
Stop this crazy carrying on
It's gonna be the death of me

It's gonna be the end you see
It's gonna be the death of me

And I feel like I'm gonna die
I don't feel so good inside
Why baby, why, why, why?
Boy, I had a good time, you know I had a good night

I feel like I'm gonna die
Why baby, why, why, why?
I don't feel so good inside
Boy, I had a good time, you know I had a good night, alright
