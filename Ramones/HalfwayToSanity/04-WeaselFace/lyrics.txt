Twenty four hours ago, no one could help me
I'm alone in life, no where to go

So, I picked up the phone, called out for help
Some one please help me, I'm afraid and alone

Weasel face, weasel face, weasel face
Weasel face, weasel face, weasel face

It's way past midnight, TV set is on
It's my only friend, one crisis after another

Ain't no loser or quitter, it's all or nothing baby
'Cause we fought so hard for our piece of this world

Weasel face, weasel face, weasel face
Weasel face, weasel face, weasel face

Twenty four hours ago, no one could help me
I'm alone in life, no where to go

Weasel face, weasel face, weasel face
Weasel face, weasel face, weasel face

Weasel face, weasel face, weasel face
Weasel face, weasel face, weasel face
