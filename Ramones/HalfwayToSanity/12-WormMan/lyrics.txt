I'm a worm man
I'm fed up
There's no hope
I wanna puke
I want some dirt

I'm a w-w-worm man

Gonna crawl in a hole
Nobody's my friend
I'm no good to anyone
I want some dirt

I'm a w-w-worm man

Well all right, well all right
Well all right, well all right
Well all right, well all right
Well all right...hey!

I'm no good to anyone
Nobody's my friend
I'll never be happy
I hate myself

I wish I was dead
I wish I was dead
I wish I was dead
