She went away for the holidays
Said she's going to L.A.
But she never got there
She never got there
She never got there, they say
[x2]

[Chorus: x2]
The KKK took my baby away
They took her away
Away from me

Now I don't know
Where my baby has been
They took her from me
They took her from me
I don't know
Where my baby has been
They took her from me
They took her from me

Ringy, ringy, ringy
Up the President
And find out
Where my baby went
Ringy, ringy, ringy
Up the FBI
And find out if
My baby's alive
Yeah, yeah, yeah

oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh

She went away for the holidays
Said she's going to L.A.
But she never got there
She never got there
She never got there, they say
[x2]

[Chorus: x3]

The KKK took my baby away
They took my girl
They took my baby away
